        habitat: "Habitat:",
        detail: "Gorillas primarily inhabit tropical forest habitats. Tropical forests are characterized as having little variance in temperature (around 23°C) and length of daylight (around 12 hours). However, rainfall varies considerably in the tropics and is a primary factor as to the type of vegetation that grows in an area. Lowland areas of tropical forests usually have a prolonged dry season and usually consist of thorny shrubs, trees, and succulents (plants that are able to store water in their cells). Other areas that have distinct wet and dry seasons are usually composed of tropical deciduous forests. Deciduous trees and shrubs lose their leaves during the dry season and generate new leaves when it rains.",
        distribution: "Distribution:",
        details:"The western lowland gorilla inhabits the tropical forests of Cameroon, Central African Republic, Gabon, Congo, and Equatorial Guinea (West Africa). The eastern lowland gorilla inhabits the tropical forests of Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The mountain gorilla inhabits the high altitude (1,650-3,790 m/5,413-12,435 ft) tropical forests of Zaire, Rwanda, and Uganda (around the Virunga volcanoes). The Cross River gorilla inhabits a small area between Nigeria and Cameroon.",
        population:"Population:",
        Details: "The western lowland gorilla is the most numerous of gorilla species with a population estimate of 92,000 in 1999. However this estimate does not reflect the detrimental impact that the bushmeat trade and Ebola virus has had on the population since 1999. Many western lowland gorillas live in isolated populations which restricts access to potential mates. This isolation can affect the health of the existing population as well as severely reduce future birthrates. The eastern lowland gorilla had a population estimate in 1998 of about 17,000 individuals in isolated populations. However this estimate does not reflect the detrimental impact that the bushmeat trade and warfare has had on the population since 1998. The mountain gorilla is estimated to have several small protected family groups living around the Virunga volcanoes (about 380 individuals) and the Bwindi area (about 320 individuals). Even though many mountain gorillas live in protected parks, disease outbreaks, environmental catastrophic events, and genetic isolation could significantly reduce their population. Conservation International and the primate specialist division of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) have classified this species as one of the 25 most endangered primates. It is estimated that the Cross River gorilla has a population of about 250 to 280 individuals. Conservation International and the primate specialist division of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) have classified this species as one of the 25 most endangered primates.",
        size: "Size:-",
        Size:"The gorilla is the largest of all primates. Western lowland adult male gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) are about 1.7 m (66.9 in.) in body length and weigh about 169.5 kg (374 lbs.). Adult females are about 1.5 m (59.1 in.) in body length and weigh about 71.5 kg (158 lbs.). Adult male mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) may weigh up to 220 kg (484 lbs.) and females weigh about 97.7 kg (215 lbs.). Cross River gorillas (Gorilla gorilla diehli) have been difficult to study due to their shy nature. However, it is estimated that an adult male weighs about 180 kg (396 lbs.). Eastern lowland gorillas (Gorilla berengei graueri) are slightly larger than the western species, with adult males weighing up to 220 kg (484 lbs.) and females weighing about 80 kg (176 lbs.).",
        body:"Shape:",
        Shape:"Gorillas have a distinctive shape in that their stomachs are larger than their chests. Their stomach size is attributed to their enlarged intestines, which digest the bulky fibrous vegetation they consume. ",
        Coloration: "Coloration:",
        Color :"Gorillas have dark skin and black to brown-grey hair. Males acquire silver-gray saddles across their backs and upper thighs at sexual maturity, earning them the name silverback. This silver-gray area breaks up their overall dark coloration, creating an optical illusion of increased length and larger size. Lowland gorillas have shorter sparse hair whereas mountain gorillas have long and silky hair. Adult gorillas lack hair on their fingers, palms, soles, nose, lips, ears, and chest",
        Head:"Head:",
        head:"The head of a gorilla is massive, with a bulging forehead overhanging the eyes and a bony sagittal crest on top (high-domed head). The sagittal crest (especially noticeable in males) supports the large temporal muscles needed to grind coarse vegetation.",
        Skin: "Tail:",
        skin : "Gorillas, unlike monkeys, do not have tails.",
        Nose: "Nose:",
        nose:"Gorillas' nose regions are very distinctive in terms of the shape and wrinkles and are used by researchers to distinguish individual animals in the field.",
        Dentition:"Dentition:",
        dentition:"Gorillas have 32 teeth — the same number as humans. Gorillas have large strong teeth adapted for the coarse vegetation they consume. Adult males develop big, sharp canines as they mature. Gorillas have two full sets of teeth during their lifetime, similar to humans. The first set (similar to baby teeth) is lost and then replaced by their permanent set as adults.",
        hand:"Hands and Feet:",
        feet:"The thumb and big toe of gorillas oppose the other digits (fingers/toes), enabling them to grasp and manipulate objects. All primates have individualized fingerprints and toeprints, which may be used for identification purposes in the field. Gorillas are able to manipulate objects with their feet as well as their hands because of their opposable big toe.Primates have fingernails and toenails rather than claws. They are used for opening, scraping, cleaning, and scratching.",
        arm:"Arms:",
        arms:"Gorillas have larger muscles in their arms than in their legs (the opposite is true for humans). This is primarily due to the fact that they use their increased arm strength for bending and gathering foliage and for defense. Although capable of walking upright on two feet they most often walk as a quadruped (on four limbs). Gorillas' arms are much longer than their legs and their arm span is about 30 cm (1 ft.) longer than that of an adult human male. The elongated arms indicate a tree-dwelling ancestry even though gorillas are now primarily terrestrial (ground-dwelling). An adult gorilla's upper body strength is six times more powerful than that of an adult human — enabling them to lift, break, and squeeze heavy objects.",
        Senses:"Senses:-",
        hear:"Hearing:",
        hearing:"Since visibility is often restricted by dense vegetation, hearing is important for gorillas to locate one another and to detect danger. Gorillas seem to respond to unusual noises that are not a part of their normal activity.",
        eye:"Eyesight:",
        Eyesight:"Gorillas have good eyesight which is used for finding and identifying food and to detect movement. As daytime herbivores they probably have color vision, a useful adaptation for finding ripening fruits in treetops. Primates have forward facing eyes rather than one on each side of their head. This provides binocular vision because each eye's field of vision overlaps creating a three dimensional image. Binocular vision enables them to accurately assess distances and depth which is extremely useful for maneuvering within their complex environment. Gorillas and humans have a specialized area of the eye called the fovea, which contains numerous condensed light-sensitive cells and allows for good visual acuity. Unlike monkeys, gorillas tend to rely more on vision than smell.",
        Smell:"Smell:",
        smell:"Gorillas have a good sense of smell and are able to detect strong odors in the environment such as human sweat or the musk of an unknown gorilla. Males use a female's odor to determine her reproductive status.",
        Communication:"Communication:-",
        Sound:"Primate Communication:",
        Production:"Primates communicate for identification of appropriate species, gender and reproductive status of potential mates, predator avoidance/protection, and the maintenance of social relationships.",
        Language:"Vocalizations:",
        language:"It is estimated that gorillas have at least 22 distinct sounds used for communication — though there is no identifiable language such as in humans. Gorilla sounds are extremely varied from alarm calls to an infant's whimper. They frequently grunt towards the end of their midday nap session as if to communicate their rest period is about to end.",
        Visual:"Visual:",
        visual: "Gorillas, like all primates, have forward facing eyes (overlapping fields of vision) which increases their visual acuity for depth perception. Gorillas have very similar facial expressions to humans. Aggression is often displayed by a stern, fixed stare with lips pressed tightly together. Fearful displays are made with an open mouth/exposed canines and their eyes shift nervously. Playful displays are done open mouthed/no teeth showing and relaxed eyes. Gorillas do not like being directly stared at. Direct eye contact is a sign of aggression.",
        Behavior:"Behavior:-",
        Observation:"Social Structure:",
        observation:"Gorillas are non-territorial and live in groups called troops that generally consist of 1 to 4 adult males (called silverbacks), some juvenile males (called black backs), several adult females and young. The oldest and strongest adult male silverback is usually dominant in the troop and has exclusive breeding rights to the females. Adolescent females transfer to another troop before reproducing at around 8 years of age. Generally the first troop a female reproduces in will become her permanent family. A female's status or rank in the family is generally determined by the order in which she was recruited into the troop. Late arrivals do not receive the benefits of high ranking females such as having their offspring remain close to the dominant silverback for protection. It is for this reason that females most often join a lone silverback or a newly formed troop rather than a long-established one. An adolescent male most often splits from his parent group due to lack of breeding opportunity. Usually the adolescent male will remain solitary until he forms his own troop. This process takes several years and begins by the juvenile male separating himself just outside from the troop. As time progresses, his distances increase from the parental group. Troop populations usually range in size from 2 to 12 individuals with 9 being the average. They are highly synchronized in their activity patterns. If a troop consists of multiple silverbacks they are usually the sons of the dominant adult male silverback. One of the largest gorilla troops identified had 4 silverbacks, 5 blackbacks, 12 adult females, and 16 young. Gorilla troops have a home range between 4-25 km2 (1.5-9.7 miles2).",
        Social:"Social Behavior:",
        social:"Silverbacks are typically more aggressive than other group members since the troop's safety is their responsibility. The silverback makes all group decisions, is responsible for most of the calls, receives the dominant portion of food (even when resources are limited) and can terminate troublesome behavior with just a look. A male must have an established home range and great strength to confront any rival before acquiring his own troop. Therefore most silverbacks are usually solitary for about 4 years and turn 15 before acquiring a troop of their own. Adult females are not bonded to one another and usually compete to groom and stay close to the silverback. Mothers are closely bonded to their offspring for the first three years of life. Competition for adult females is high and will often result in aggressive interactions between a dominant and rival silverback who is looking to either start or expand a troop. These confrontations may intermittently last for days and involve all the troop members.",
        Individual:"Individual Behaviors:",
        individual:"Gorillas build nests to sleep in and the presence of sufficient nesting material determines the location in which they bed. Nest construction varies, but usually consists of bent/broken vines and branches formed around and underneath each individual. Infants sleep in their mother's nest until they are about 3 years of age. However, some offspring as young as 8 months practice nest building. Nests function to keep the gorillas off the cold ground, prevent them slipping down a slope, or support them in a tree during the night. Researchers can identify the size, age, activity and make-up of a gorilla troop based on their nests. Gorillas most often walk quadrupedally (four-footed) with limited bipedal (two-footed) movements. Gorillas and chimpanzees have a distinctive walk called knuckle-walking. The walk derived its name because they walk on their knuckles, not on their palms. Gorillas usually travel only about 0.5 to 1 km (0.3 to 0.6 mi.) per day when there is ample food supply, since they have a slow pace and relatively large body size which makes it difficult to travel extensively. It is extremely rare that gorillas would compete for or share food.",
        protection:"Protection and Care:",
        care:"The dominant silverback is responsible for the protection and safety of the troop. When in a threatening situation, the silverback will ferociously beat its chest, produce loud scowling vocalizations and a pungent odor (which humans can detect from over 25 yards away), throw vegetation and charge at its opponent or intruder. Researchers have discovered that 99% of their charges are bluffs; providing the rest of the troop time for retreating to a safe distance. However if pressed, the silverback will follow through with his threat. The dominant silverback is responsible for the protection and safety of the troop.

        Food:"Food Intake:",
        Intake:"An adult male gorilla may consume more than 18 kg (40 lbs.) of vegetation per day. Gorillas rarely drink in the wild because they consume succulent vegetation that is comprised of almost half water as well as morning dew.",

        Shape:"A horse's body is adapted for speed. Other animals, such as antelope, are as fast as the horse, but not nearly as large. The Clydesdale is an immensely strong, barrel-chested horse. It was originally bred for hauling and doing farm work.",
        Coloration: "Coloration:",
        Color :"The most common Clydesdale colors are bay (a deep mahogany brown) and brown, though some may be gray, black, or roan (bay with some white hairs). White markings on the face, legs, and sometimes on the body are typical of this breed.",
        Head:"Head:",
        head:"The head has a relatively elongated muzzle, providing space for the teeth. A Clydesdale's profile is just slightly convex ('Roman' nose), compared to the more concave profiles of other breeds. The eyes are well above ground level while the horse is grazing. This provides the horse with a greater area of vision to look out for potential danger. The ears are exceptionally mobile. A horse can move its ears toward the direction of a sound.",
        Skin: "Hooves:",
        skin : "In odd-toed hoofed mammals, the body's weight is borne on the central or third digit (toe). The main axis of the foot passes through the third digit, which is the longest on all four feet. In all horses, only the third digit of each foot is functional. The remaining digits are vestigial (reduced and nonfunctioning). The single functional digit of a horse's foot is completely surrounded by a hoof composed of keratin (a tough, fibrous protein which also composes a human's fingernail). The hooves protect a horse's feet from the terrain. A horse's stance is known as unguligrade. They walk on their hooves, which are at the tips of the digits, or toes. By contrast, cats have a digitigrade stance (on the toes), and humans have a plantigrade stance (on the soles of the feet). A horseshoe for a full-grown Clydesdale measures more than 51 cm (22 in.) from end to end and weighs about 2.3 kg (5 lb.). It's more than two times as long and four times as heavy as shoes worn by a riding horse. To shoe a horse, excess hoof growth is trimmed away. The shoe is then attached to the hoof by eight nails, each 8 to 10 cm (3-4 in.) in length. Shoes for the hind feet have tips that curve out for additional support and traction, since these feet bear the heaviest load when hauling. Shoes are reset approximately every six weeks.",
        Nose: "Limbs:",
        nose:"Horses are cursorial (adapted for running). They're adapted to a mobile open-country existence. Specializations of the leg and foot enable these animals to be swift and strong runners. In the forelegs, the ulna is reduced in size so that all the weight is carried by the radius. The radius and ulna are fused. In the hind legs, the fibula is reduced in size so that all the weight is supported by the tibia. The tibia and fibula are fused.",
        Dentition:"Teeth:",
        dentition:"Depending upon the breed, horses have 40 to 48 teeth that continually grow throughout their lifetime. Rear teeth have tablelike surfaces crossed by ridges that form a grinding surface between the upper and lower jaw.

        hand:"Hair:",
        feet:"Horses have two types of hair: the fine and comparatively short hair of the coat, and the coarser and longer hair known as horsehair. The horsehair forms the forelock (hair on forehead), mane, tail, tuft of hair at the back of the fetlock (the lower part of the leg) and the feather (the long white hair found on the Clydesdale's ankle). Long, coarse bristles about the muzzle and eyes of a horse are generously supplied with nerves and act as delicate organs of touch.

Horses use a wide variety of postures and facial expressions to communicate with each other. Male horses exhibit the flehmen reaction in response to the scent of a female's urine. This reaction is characterized by a curling of the upper lip, and males exhibit it before breeding.

        Coloration: "Hair & Coloration:",
        Color : "The hair of the tiger provides camouflage, warmth and protection for them. Tigers possess two types of hair, guard hair and underfur. The guard hairs are longer and more durable than the underfur and mainly function for protection purposes. The primary function of the tiger's hair is for warmth. The underfur traps air which insulates the tiger's body thereby keeping it warm. Tigers are the only large cat species to have distinctive striping located on both the hair and skin of the tiger. Many tigers possess stripes on their face, sides, legs and stomach. The striping is varied in width, length, whether they are single or double-looped, coloration from a light brown to dark black and are not symmetrical from one side of the tiger to the other. The stripe patterning on top of the tiger's head resembles the Chinese character of 'wang' which means 'king.'  Tiger Background Coloration: Many tigers possess the light yellow-orange to deep reddish-orange background coloration. Black or melanistic colored tigers have been reported but further research is required before assessing whether these sightings were of true melanistic tigers or darker versions of the orange tiger (with few large broad dark stripes). Tigers with white background coloration are not considered albinos. An albino would be pure white in color (no striping) and would have pink or red eyes. White tigers are leucocystic meaning that they have a recessive gene that causes them to lack dark colors. Therefore they usually have a white color with light to medium brown striping and blue eyes. For unknown reasons, white tigers seem to grow bigger and at a faster rate than their orange counterparts. There have been reported sightings of blue tigers. There is little evidence supporting this color variation in tigers. However, since the blue colored trait exists in some lynx and bobcat families; it is not ruled out as a possibility. Tigers have distinctive white circular spots on the backside of their ears. There are two ideas as to the function of these eyespots. One of which is that they function as 'false eyes'; making the tiger seem bigger and watchful to a potential predator attacking from the rear. The other idea is that they play a role in aggressive communication because when threatened tigers may twist their ears around so that the backs face forward. This prominently displays the distinctive white markings. The function of the white markings is probably a combination of both ideas.",
        Head:"Head & Collarbone:",
        head:"The skull of the tiger is stout and rounded in shape which provides more support for their powerful jaws. Tigers' powerful jaw muscles are attached to a bony ridge that lay on top of the skull called the sagittal crest. These muscles function to rapidly clamp down on prey with crushing force. Tigers have a reduced-sized clavicle (collarbone). This characteristic enables them to attain greater stride lengths because the smaller clavicle allows for a wider, unrestricted range of movement of the scapula (shoulder blade) when running.",
        Skin: "Tail:",
        skin : "A tiger's tail is about one meter in length (3 ft) and may play a part in their visual communication (see communication- vision section). Tigers use their tail for balance when making sharp turns in pursuit of prey.",
        Dentition:"Dentition:",
        dentition:"Tigers have fewer teeth than other carnivores such as dogs (42 teeth) with only 30 teeth. Tigers have the largest canines of all big cat species ranging in size from 6.4 to 7.6 centimeters (2.5 to 3.0 in) in length. The canines have abundant pressure-sensing nerves that enable the tiger to identify the location needed to sever the neck of its prey. The back teeth of the tiger are called carnassials which enables the tiger to shear meat from their prey like knife blades. They swallow large-sheared pieces of meat whole. Tigers are capable of penetrating deeply into their prey because of the large gap between the carnassials (back teeth) and the canines hold prey tightly. The small incisors located in the front of the mouth (between the two top and bottom canines) enable the tiger to pick off meat and feathers from their prey.",
        Nose: "Digestion:",
        nose:"The process of converting meat to protein (needed for energy) is significantly less complicated in carnivores than it is to convert grass to protein as some herbivores require. Carnivores do not require the vast amount of microbes (microscopic bacteria) living in their intestines to break down indigestible plant cellulose. Therefore tigers and other carnivores have small and light weight stomachs that do not hinder them when they are accelerating quickly to chase prey.",

        feet:"The hind legs of the tiger are longer than their front legs. This characteristic enables them to leap forward distances up to 10 meters (32.5 ft). The bones of the tiger's front legs are strong and dense to support the large musculature needed to take down large prey. The bones in each of the tiger's feet are tightly connected by ligaments enabling them to buffer the impact of landing from running, pouncing and leaping. Tigers have large padded feet that enable them to silently stalk prey in the Asian jungles. The claws of the tiger are up to 10 centimeters (4 in) in length and are used to grasp and hold onto prey. Each paw has four of these claws and one specialized claw called a dewclaw. A dewclaw is located farther back on the foot and thereby does not touch the ground when walking. Dewclaws function similarly to thumbs in that they are used for grasping prey and aid in climbing. Tiger claws are retractable in that ligaments hold them in a protective skin sheath when their not being used. The ligaments are in a relaxed position when the claws are retracted thereby expending no musculature effort. Tigers retract their claws to ensure that they remain sharp for times when they are needed and to tread silently up to unsuspecting prey. Other ligaments will extract the claws when attacking prey or defending themselves which does require musculature effort. Tiger claws are curved which enables them to superiorly grasp and hold large prey and climb trees head-first. However, the claws' curvature, the tiger's size and weight is a great hindrance in climbing down from trees. Tigers must either crawl backwards or jump down from trees, making them the most inferior climbers of the big cat family.",
        Senses:"Senses:-",
        hear:"Hearing:",
        hearing:"The tiger's sense of hearing is the most acute all its senses and is mainly used for hunting. Their ears are capable of rotating, similar to a radar dish, to detect the origins of various sounds such as the high-frequency sounds produced by prey in the dense forest undergrowth. Cats in general are more sensitive to high-pitched sounds than humans are. Cats may hear sounds up to 60 kHz whereas a human's upper auditory range is about 20 kHz. This sensitivity enables them to detect the high-pitched sounds emitted by prey and their movements.",
        eye:"Eyesight:",
        Eyesight:"Tigers have forward facing eyes rather than one on each side of their head. This provides binocular vision because each eye's field of vision overlaps creating a three dimensional image. Binocular vision enables them to accurately assess distances and depth which is extremely useful for maneuvering within their complex environment and stalking prey. Tigers have more rods (responsible for visual acuity for shapes) in their eyes than cones (responsible for color vision) to assist with their night vision. The increased number of rods allows them to detect movement of prey in darkness where color vision would not be useful. Tigers have a structure at the back of the eye behind the retina called the tapetum lucidum that enables them to have better night vision. This mirrorlike structure reflects light (that has not already been absorbed by the eye) back into the eye a second time to help produce a brighter image. The tapetum lucidum causes their eyes to glow at night when a light is shone on them. iger eyes have large lenses and pupils that increase the amount of light let into the eye. This characteristic helps the tiger with night vision and when there are low light levels available. Research suggests that cats in general are capable of seeing the colors green, blue and possibly red, just in less saturation or strength than we see them. In addition to the upper and lower eyelids that protect the eye, cats and other animals such as crocodilians (alligators, crocodiles, etc.) have a nictitating membrane on each eye that helps keep it moist and removes dust from the surface. In general cats require only about 1/6 the light humans do to see.",
        Smell:"Smell:",
        smell:"The tiger's sense of smell is not as acute as some of its other senses and is generally not used for hunting. They have small amounts of odor-detecting cells in their nose and a reduced olfactory region in the brain that identifies various scents. The tiger mainly uses its sense of smell for communicating information with one another such as territories and reproductive status. Tigers, like other carnivores, have a Jacobson organ in the roof of their mouth. The Jacobson organ is a pouch-like structure located directly behind the front incisors. It has two small openings that direct scent particles from the air as the tiger inhales to nerves located within the structure. The nerves then transmit the message to the olfactory region in the brain that identifies the scent. Tigers will exhibit a behavior called flehman, in which they pick up a scent on their upper lip and curl it upwards towards their nose to detect scents. This behavior makes the tiger appear to be snarling but without any sound.", 
        Taste:"Taste:",
        taste:"Tigers seem to be able to taste salt, bitter and acidic flavors and to a lesser degree sweetness. Cats in general possess only about 500 taste buds compared to a human's 9,000. Therefore taste buds are speculated to have a minimal role in their survivability.",
        Communication:"Communication:-",
        Sound:"Vocal:",
        Production:"Tigers utilize a variety of vocalizations to communicate over long distances. Roaring is produced in a variety of situations such as taking down large prey, signaling sexual receptivity and females calling to their young. These roars may be heard from distances over 3 km (1.8 mi.). Moaning vocalizations are described as a subdued roar made while tigers are calmly walking with their heads in a downward position. This vocalization is audible for distances less than 400 m (440 yd.). Chuffing are friendly vocalizations that generally consist of a soft brrr sound. These vocalizations are primarily used for greetings between tigers and only audible at close range.",
        Visual:"Visual:",
        visual: "Tigers use their tails to communicate with one another. A tiger is relaxed if their tail is loosely hanging. Aggression is displayed by rapidly moving the tail from side to side or by holding it low with occasional intense twitches. Tigers may enhance their olfactory communication by using visual markings such as scrapes on the ground and trees.",
        Language:"Scent & Touch:",
        language:"Adult males and females both communicate to one another by marking their territories. An adult tiger will usually define the boundary of its territory by spraying urine because of the strong odor associated with it can last up to 40 days but they may also use feces for marking. All cats, including tigers, have a distinct scent associated with them due to their individualized scent glands. The individualized scent helps cubs track their mother's path and serves to identify particular individuals. Cats have scent glands between their toes, tail, anus, head, chin, lips, cheeks, and facial whiskers. A common behavior of the domestic cat is rubbing against its caregiver's legs, face and furniture. The cat's intention is to leave its individualized scent to communicate with other animals its territory and belongings. The scientific community is currently trying to train dogs to detect some individualized tiger scents to assist with the estimation of wild tiger populations. The scent glands between a tiger's toes leave behind an individualized scent that enables a cub to follow its mother's footsteps.",
        Behavior:"Behavior:-",
        Observation:"Social Structure:",
        observation:"Tigers are territorial and usually solitary in nature. Their social system is connected through visual signals, scent marks and vocalizations. Tigers are usually solitary in nature, interacting briefly only for mating purposes and occasionally to share their kill. However, there has been a few rare instances documented in which tigers have collaborated on a hunt, similar to a pride of lions. The size of tiger territories varies greatly by locality, season and prey density (the amount of prey in a given area). In areas with high prey densities, tiger territories tend to be smaller in size because ample prey may be found in smaller vicinity. For male tigers in Ranthambhore India; the prey concentrations are high and male tigers have territories that range in size from 5 to 150 km2 (2 to 60 mi2). In Siberia the prey concentrations are much lower and male tiger territories range in size from 800 to 1200 km2 (320 to 480 mi2). Seasonality in terms of prey migrations, food availability and weather may also affect prey populations and therefore the size of tiger territories.",
        Social:"Social Behavior:",
        social:"Males have larger territories than females. An adult male's territory will usually overlap several females' territories. The larger area contains more than enough food, water and shelter resources, but is larger to accommodate more females' territories. Therefore, females are the most coveted resource for males. Aggression amongst adult male tigers can be influenced by the number of tigers in a given area (density) and whether there is a social disruption in which males are competing to take control of a territory. The intensity of aggression increased when there are high tiger densities for a given area because there is more competition of resources and mating opportunities. Resident male territory-holders may be challenged by other young males for possession of the territory or the young males may challenge each for ownership if the resident male has vacated or dies. The strongest male will take possession of the territory. These times of social disruption may also cause aggression between females. Tigresses' territories are smaller than that of males but focus on vital resources required for rearing young. Tigresses usually occupy territories adjacent to or take over parts of their mother's territory.",
        Individual:"Individual Behaviors:",
        individual:"Tigers, unlike many other cat species, readily enter water to cool themselves and in the pursuit of prey. They are powerful swimmers and capable of traversing lakes and rivers. Tigers assert and maintain their control over their territories by continuously patrolling them.",
        protection:"Daily Activity Cycle:",
        care:"Tigers are mainly active at night and less active during the mid-day heat. However, this pattern may vary. Grooming is an important part of the tiger's day. They use their rasping tongue to remove loose hairs and dirt from their fur. The grooming process keeps the tiger's coat in good condition by using their tongues to spread oils secreted from their glands.",
        Eating:"Eating Habits:-",
        Food:"Diet:",
        Intake:"Tigers eat a variety of prey ranging in size from termites to elephant calves. However, an integral component of their diet are large-bodied prey weighing about 20 kg (45 lbs.) or larger such as moose, deer species, pigs, cows, horses, buffalos and goats. Occasionally they may consume tapirs, elephant and rhinoceros calves, bear species, leopards and Asiatic wild dogs."

        habitat: "Habitat & Range:",
        detail: "Cheetahs are tolerant of a wide range of habitats including shrublands, grasslands, savannahs, and temperate to hot deserts. Cheetahs largely stay on the ground but are known to climb trees on occasion. As recently as 20,000 years ago, cheetahs had a near worldwide distribution and were one of the most widely distributed land animals on the planet. Cheetahs are now found widely but sparsely across Africa, although their populations have significantly disappeared from their historical ranges in the past. In Africa, for example, it's estimated that cheetahs are no longer found in 76% of their former historic range. Cheetahs likely only exist in 6% of their former range in eastern Africa but have most drastically declined in northern and western Africa. Presently the Asiatic cheetah (A. j. venaticus) is considered restricted to Asia but today is believed to exist only in Iran. In the past, cheetahs in Asia were found from the shores of the Mediterranean and Arabian Peninsula, north to the shorelines of the Caspian and Aral Seas, and west through Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into central India.",
        population:"Population:",
        Details: "Wild cheetah populations are in decline. A study done in the mid 1970s estimated their population to be around 15,000 — currently the known population is about 7,000, with an estimated total population of no more than 10,000 mature individuals. This represents a decline of at least 30% in 18 years (three generations). The estimated percentage of cheetahs contributing to the gene pool through breeding success may be less than half of the total population. Southern Africa is home to at least 4,500 adult cheetahs. Unfortunately, a large group of this population lives outside protected habitats — away from lions and other potentially threatening carnivores — on ranchlands where they have the potential to encounter livestock and human farmers. In Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, southern Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania) there is an estimated 2,572 adults and independent adolescents. Reliable population estimates are difficult to find for the remainder of Africa. In northwest Africa the population of A. j. heckii is likely less than 250 mature individuals. Across Asia, cheetahs are now only known to exist in Iran where the population of A. j. venaticus is estimated at only 60 to 100 individuals.",
        size: "Size:-",
        Size:"Adult cheetah males are typically larger than females. Body lengths of cheetahs range from 112 to 150 cm (3.93-4.92 ft.), tail lengths are between 60 to 80 cm (2-2.62 ft.) and the height at the shoulder ranges from 67 to 94 cm (2.2-3.1 ft.). Their weights average from 21 to 72 kg (46-158 lb.), with the average male larger than the average female.",
        Coloration: "Coloration:",
        Color : "Cheetahs have an upper coat of fur that is tawny, pale buff or grayish white, with underparts that are paler and whiter. Black spots are set close together on the pelage with a series of black rings around the last one-third of the tail. Black tear markings under the eyes are thought to protect against the sun's glare and to help focus better attention on prey. Based on an usual color variation, an additional cheetah species was described in 1927 — A. rex, or the king cheetah. The species was based upon cheetahs that were found to have longer, softer hair and replacement of some spotted patterns with dark bars. However, it is now generally accepted that this was simply a very rare color variation of A. jubatus. Cheetah kittens have fur colored in a way that is opposite normal countershading, in theory to mimic the coloration of a honey badger. A vast majority of mammals are countershaded — the top area of its body is darker than the underneath surface. Countershading helps an animal to blend in with its environment and appear inconspicuous. Honey badgers (Mellivora capensis), known in part for their highly aggressive nature, are more visible with their opposing countershaded coloration (light on top while darker on their undersides). This likely serves as a visual warning so they can be more easily seen by larger predators and avoided. Cheetah kittens are highly susceptible to predators like lions that rely heavily on eyesight to target prey. With coloration similar to honey badgers, in theory predators may spot them from a distance and may avoid them if mistaken for a honey badger.",
        Head:"Head:",
        head:"Cheetahs have relatively small heads, small ears, and high set eyes. Rapid acceleration requires a cheetah to have high oxygen intake adaptations including enlarged nostrils and extensive, air-filled sinuses. While running, a cheetah's specially adapted repertory system allows it to go from a normal rate of 60 breaths per minute to 150 breaths per minute. Less developed whiskers around the face suggest that cheetahs are not as active hunting at night compared to other felids.",
        Skin: "Tail:",
        skin : "The tail of a cheetah can measure 66 to 84 cm (26-33 in.), which is about two-thirds of its body length. During fast sprints, a cheetah's paws have minimal contact with the ground. At such times, a cheetah's tail stretches out and acts as a counterbalance during sharp turns. The flattened tip of the tail also acts like a rudder to guide direction.",
        Dentition:"Dentition:",
        dentition:"In a tradeoff for having various adaptations needed for rapid acceleration to pursue prey, such as a reduced muzzle and smaller skull size, cheetahs have weak jaws and smaller canine teeth compared to other large cats. This leaves cheetahs vulnerable when it comes to defending captured prey from other larger predators.",
        Nose: "Eyes:",
        nose:"Cheetahs have a small, thin-boned skull with a relatively flat face and reduced muzzle size — these adaptations allow their large eyes to be positioned for maximum binocular vision. There is a high concentration of nerve cells leading to the optic nerve, which allows cheetahs to detect prey in open habitats that move against the horizon. A nictitating membrane further shields and protects the eyes during fast sprints.",
        hand:"Paws:",
        feet:"Cheetahs have paws that are narrower than other large felids, resembling the paws of dogs rather than cats. Cheetahs have claws that are blunt, slightly curved and only semi-retractable. Cheetah claws are like running spikes, used to increase traction while pursuing prey. Ridges running along the footpads act like car tire treads for additional traction.",
        arm:"Internal Anatomy:",
        arms:"Cheetahs possess an enlarged heart, oversized liver, adrenals, bronchi, and lungs, and large arteries — adaptations necessary for an animal that relies on explosive speed to capture prey. A cheetah's body temperature is approximately 38.3°C (101°F) but increases to 40°C (105°F) after sprinting.",
        Senses:"Longevity & Causes of Death:-",
        hear:"Diseases:",
        hearing:"Diseases seen in captive cheetahs include cirrhosis of the liver, feline distemper, pneumonia and other bronchial diseases, rickets, and tuberculosis. Another general effect of low genetic diversity is an increase in the cheetah's susceptibility to diseases. The biggest disease threat to wild cheetahs is naturally occurring anthrax in Namibia's Etosha National Park. Unlike other predators in the area, cheetahs do not scavenge remains of ungulate carcasses killed by anthrax, thus they lack built up immunities as they prey upon springbok sickened and weakened by the disease.",
        eye:"Longevity:",
        Eyesight:"In zoological parks, the maximum known longevity for cheetahs is 20.5 years. Studies have not been conducted in the wild on the longevity of cheetahs. Lifespans in the wild are difficult to determine, especially for males since they often move. Cheetah cubs apparently have a high mortality rate, which may be related to genetic diversity issues. In one study of captive born cheetahs, 29% of the cubs died within six months and only half reached adulthood — an infant mortality rate far higher than most other animal species studied. Older male and female cheetahs were found to be in significantly poorer health. Many had broken teeth, which likely contributed to their overall poor physical condition. In places like Namibia, up to 95% of cheetahs are found on livestock farmland areas. Ranchers in Africa pose a major threat to cheetahs, who often perceive cheetahs as harmful to their livestock. However, studies have shown that cheetahs were responsible for only about a 3% loss to African livestock.",
        Communication:"Communication:-",
        Sound:"Sound Production:",
        Production:"Cheetahs produce a variety of sounds including growls, purrs that generally denote contentment, chirps (between a mother and her cubs), and an 'explosive yelp' heard by humans from 2 km (1.24 mi.) away. Moans, growls, hisses, and spitting vocalizations are generally produced in agonistic or combative situations. As a threat escalates, a cheetah will crouch and begin to moan, followed quite often by growling and hissing. The next phase of a cheetah's agonistic vocalization response is growling, which is often combined with hissing and moaning sounds. The agonistic response usually ends as the cheetah creates a spitting sound, which is often uniquely combined with the cheetah forcefully hitting one or both front paws to the ground.",
        Visual:"'Purring' vs. 'Roaring' Cats:",
        visual: "The Felidae family is subdivided between the 'roaring cats' and the 'purring cats' based on the work done by Owens in 1834 and 1835. 'Roaring cats' (lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards) have an incompletely ossified hyoid, which in theory allows them to roar but not to purr. Cheetahs belong to the 'purring cats' subfamily and as such do not roar. Many animals are said to purr, but a large 2002 study defined purring as a continuous sound production that must 'alternate between pulmonic egressive and ingressive airstream (and usually go on for minutes).' Under this stricter definition, the only animals known to 'purr' in this manner are felids in the 'purring cat' subfamily and two species of genets (Genetta tigrina and likely Genetta genetta as well). Cats purr during both inhalation and exhalation with a consistent pattern and frequency between 25 to 150 Hz — studies have shown that sound produced in this range can improve bone density. Cats that purr often do so as a form of communication, but cats are known to rest for long periods of time, which may lead to bone density loss and muscle atrophy. In theory, purring may also be a low energy mechanism to stimulate bone and muscle healing. Cheetah (Purring): , African Lion (Roaring): .",
        Language:"Territorial Marking:",
        language:"Like other members of Felidae family, male cheetahs are known to mark their territories with urine. Items most commonly marked include objects that immediately stood out in an environment such as tree and shrubs. In an open area, plants that stood out against more common plant species tend to be marked. Other male cheetahs, females, mothers, and cubs all took interest in the markings left by other groups.",
        Behavior:"Behavior:-",
        Observation:"Behavior:",
        observation:"Adult cheetahs may be found alone or in all male groups called coalitions. A coalition of male cheetahs — most likely two to three litter mates that have stayed together — defend a territory against other males, rarely but sometimes to the death. Coalition membership may last for the entire life of the male. Occasionally a non-related male may join into a coalition, but often must endure periods of aggression from the other (related) members. Related coalition members spend much time in close proximity and often touch and groom each other. Territorial coalitions rarely leave their area of residency, except occasionally to seek females in heat outside their territory and only then for no more than a few days at a time. If coalition members become lost or separated, the individuals will call out to each other with a series of yips until they are reunited. Females in an area of migratory prey follow the herds, while coalition males establish small territories and attempt to mate with females that pass through. Where prey animals are non-migratory, males and females may establish smaller, overlapping ranges usually similar in size. Cheetah females studied in the Serengeti may roam an area of some 829 square km (320 square mi.). Solitary individuals are generally semi-nomadic and may occupy large ranges of land that overlap with the territories of other cheetahs. A solitary male rarely holds onto a territory against a coalition of cheetahs. Nonterritorial males are nomadic, typically an adolescent, can cover a large amount a ground quickly and rarely remain in an area for more than a few days. ",
        Eating:"Eating Habits:-",
        Food:"Diet:",
        Intake:"Gazelles (especially Gazella thompsonii), impalas (Aepyceros melampus), other small- to medium-sized ungulates, plus calves of larger ungulate species are the primary diet of cheetahs. In addition, hares (Lepus spp.), small mammals, and birds may also be taken.",
        hunting: "Hunting:",
        Hunting: "'Fast twitch' muscle fibers provide power over endurance, and cheetahs have up to a 20% higher concentration of these specialized fibers compared to other fast moving animals like greyhounds and horses. 'Fast twitch' muscle fibers are efficient for only a few minutes during times when the supply of oxygen is reduced through anaerobic respiration. To capture prey, cheetahs are capable of accelerating from 0 to 80 km/h (50 mph) in just three strides, with a maximum speed of 110 km/h (68.35 mph) in a few seconds. However, cheetahs have little endurance so the pursuit of prey must be well timed out. Unlike most other cats, cheetahs do not ambush their prey or attack within springing distance. Prey may be spotted within seconds or stalked for hours. When the cheetah is within 70 to 100 m (230 to 330 ft.), the chase begins. A chase lasts perhaps 20 seconds, with few pursuits exceeding one minute. The distance covered averages 170 m (550 ft.), but some may continue pursuit for about 500 m (1,640 ft.). Rarely will a cheetah attempt an attack if more than 200 m (650 ft.) away from prey. During a fast sprint all four paws of a cheetah do not touch the ground when the legs are fully contracted under the body and as the legs become fully extended. A single stride may cover 7 m (23 ft.) — the same distance as a much larger race horse in full stride. At near maximum acceleration, a cheetah runs about one stride per 0.28 seconds or 3.5 strides per second. Cheetahs have a curved dewclaw on their forelegs. While in pursuit, as a cheetah nears its target it will swat at and trip the prey animal with its dewclaw. Compared to other large carnivores in their area, cheetahs tend to rest through the heat of the day, concentrating their hunts later in the morning and early afternoon. This strategy may limit competition and confrontations between cheetahs and other large predators like lions and hyenas. A cheetah may attempt to first drag a kill to a hiding spot before eating. Cheetahs rarely scavenge remains they did not kill themselves, unlike other African predators. Lions, hyenas, and even vultures will drive a cheetah away from its kill, so a cheetah must often eat quickly or flee to avoid confrontations."

Tropical forests are characterized as having little variance in temperature (around 23°C) and length of daylight (around 12 hours). However, rainfall varies considerably in the tropics and is a primary factor as to the type of vegetation that grows in an area. Savannas are characterized as grasslands with widely scattered trees. They generally have distinct dry and rainy seasons. Dry Season: Usually between June and November, Rainy Season: Usually from October to December and March to June. Grasslands are characterized as having cold winter temperatures. Seasonal droughts, occasional fires, and grazing by large mammals prevent woody shrubs and trees from becoming established. Grassland soil is very nutrient rich and perennial grass roots are often deeply embedded. Woodlands are characterized as an area covered with trees and shrubs. Woodlands differ from forests by having a large, open canopy with sunlight filtering between treetops. Forests have a largely—closed canopy in which sunlight does not readily filter through the treetops and almost continuous shade is provided. Asian elephants primarily inhabit tropical forest habitats.",

        migration:"Migration:",
        Detail: "Both Asian and African elephants migrate and generally follow the same migratory routes annually. Migration distances vary considerably depending on environmental conditions. During a prolonged dry season in Africa, elephant migration distances were recorded to extend over 100 km (62 mi.). Studies documenting Asian elephants in deciduous forests of southern India, with numerous water sources, reported elephant migration to extend between 20 and 50 km (12 and 31 mi.). African elephants usually migrate at the beginning of the dry season, between June and November; heading toward more hospitable locations near rivers and water sources that are not prone to drying. When the rainy season arrives, usually from October to December and March to June, elephant herds return to native regions to feed on the lush, green vegetation the rains helped regenerate. Elephant migration allows time for the re—growth of vegetation in exhausted grazing areas. Elephant migrations occur in one of the following three ways. The migration method depends on environmental conditions. Individual family groups separate themselves from the larger herd. This method may be used in response to limited food supplies encountered during a dry season migration. If food sources are scarce along the migratory route, it is more efficient to travel as individual families, rather than large herds. Family groups traveling in this manner are generally led by a dominant female at the front of the group and another at the back, to guard the rear. The young travel between the dominant females for protection and supervision. Several family groups, usually between two and five, may form a larger group called bond groups for migration. Bond groups provide additional security due to more sets of watchful eyes. Females share leadership and supervisory responsibilities based on age, experience, and temperament. These groups require more food resources along the migratory route but benefit from increased protection. Occasionally, entire populations of elephant herds join together in mass migration, with estimates as high as 500 individuals reported. This method provides maximum protection for herds but food resources must be present along the migratory route in sufficient quantity.",

Individual forest and savanna populations have not been reported by the IUCN—The World Conservation Union, pending further genetic and phylogenic research for various hybrid classifications. The IUCN currently lists the African elephant as threatened. Currently, all Asian elephant subspecies are classified as endangered by the IUCN, with a total population estimate ranging between 25,600 and 32,750 individuals. The Indian elephant (E.m.indicus) is the most numerous with population estimates ranging between 20,000 and 25,000 individuals. The Sumatran and Sri Lankan elephants are critically endangered, with populations estimated to be between 2,440 and 3,350 for the Sumatran elephant and 3,160 and 4,400 for the Sri Lankan elephant.

        Size:"African elephants are the largest of all land animals, adult males weighing between 1,800 and 6,300 kg (2 and 7 tons/ 4,000 and 14,000 lb.). Females are smaller, weighing between 2,700 and 3,600 kg (3 and 4 tons/ 6,000 and 8,000 lb.). Shoulder height ranges between three and four m (9.8 and 13.1 ft.). Adult male Asian elephants weigh between 1,800 and 4,500 kg (2 and 5 tons/ 4,000 and 10,000 lb.), with females weighing slightly less. Shoulder height ranges between 2 and 3.5 m (6.6 and 11.5 ft.).",
        Coloration: "Trunk:",
        Color : "The elephant's trunk is an extension of the upper lip and nose. It functions for grasping, breathing, feeding, dusting, smelling, drinking, lifting, sound production/communication, defense/protection, and sensing. The trunk contains an estimated 100,000 muscles and tendons in the trunk, giving it extreme flexibility and strength. Elephant trunks are capable of expanding, contracting, and moving in a diverse array of directions. Asian elephants have one finger-like projection at the tip of the trunk and African elephants have two. These finger-like projections have many sensitive nerve endings and are capable of fine motor skills, such as grasping small and delicate objects. An adult Asian elephant can hold up to 8.5 L (2.2 gal.) of water in its trunk. Water is sprayed into the mouth for drinking and onto the back to keep cool. Elephants' trunks and keen sense of smell are used to survey the environment. The trunk is raised and waived in the air to gather scent particles. Through the trunk, the scent particles are then carried to a specialized gland called the Jacobson's organ, located in the roof of the mouth. The Jacobson's organ is able to gather information about the elephant's surroundings by detecting and analyzing molecules and particles from the air. Through this process, elephants are capable of locating water sources up to 19.2 km (12 mi.) away and can even determine the reproductive status of distant elephants. Elephants can reach vegetation as high as 5.7 m (19 ft.) by rearing up onto their hind legs and extending their trunk. Small sensory hairs extend the length of the elephant's trunk enhance its sensitivity. These small hairs facilitate tactile communication during courtship and when caring for young. Elephant trunks are very powerful-capable of uprooting an entire tree trunk, tearing down heavy branches, and delivering a forceful blow in self-defense.",
        body:"Musth Gland/Temporal Gland:",
        Shape:"Asian and African elephants have a musth gland located just beneath the skin's surface, halfway between the eye and ear on each side of their head. The musth gland may be associated with sexual activity and/or communication. Annually, musth glands secrete a dark, oily, musky substance and become inflamed. This physiological change is associated with a behavior observed in male elephants called musth. Refer to musth in the Behavior section.",
        Skin: "Skin:",
        skin : "Elephant skin is wrinkled in appearance, with African elephants more wrinkled than Asian elephants. Wrinkles act as a cooling mechanism by increasing the skin's surface area. The additional skin and wrinkles trap moisture, which then takes longer to evaporate. Therefore, wrinkles keep elephants cooler, for longer, than if they had smooth skin. Asian elephants are less wrinkled in appearance than African elephants because they primarily inhabit forested habitats. Temperatures are not as hot in forested areas, thereby reducing the need for forest-dwelling elephants to cool themselves. Elephant skin can be up to 3.8 cm (1.5 in.) thick in certain places. However, the skin is sensitive to touch, detecting insects and changes in its environment. The combination of thick skin and a thin layer of fat beneath the skin enable the elephant to tolerate cold temperatures. Overall skin coloration for elephants is grey. However, Asian elephants have a freckled appearance due to distinct patches of depigmentation, especially on the trunk.",
        Head:"Ears:",
        head:"Elephant ears are about one-sixth the size of its entire body and primarily function as a cooling mechanism. The ears contain extensive networks of tiny blood vessels, which are visible at the outer margins, where the skin is only about one to two mm (0.04 - 0.08 in.) thick. The warm blood cools as it circulates through the vessels in the ear, due to the thin layer of skin that separates it from the outside air. The cooler blood then circulates back into the body, helping reduce the overall body temperature of the elephant. The size of elephant ears is proportionate to its geographic distribution. The closer to the equator the elephant resides, the larger the ears, allowing more heat to dissipate (remove) from the body, and therefore has larger ears. African elephants live closest to the equator and have the largest ears, followed by the Asian elephants. The now extinct woolly mammoth, lived near the North Pole, and had the smallest ears. Elephants use their ears to funnel in sound waves from the environment, contributing to their keen sense of hearing.",
        Dentition:"Dentition:",
        dentition:"Both African and Asian elephants have a total of 26 teeth including two upper incisors (tusks), 12 premolars (non-permanent teeth similar to baby teeth), and 12 molars. Asian elephants have smaller tusks than those of African elephants and females have smaller tusks than males. Each adult male tusk weighs between 50 and 79 kg (110 - 175 lb.) and an adult female's tusk weighs between 18 and 20 kg (40 - 44 lb.). One of the heaviest tusks ever weighed was more than 100 kg (220 lb.). African elephants have diamond-shaped ridges on their molars, whereas Asian elephants have long cylindrical ridges on theirs. The ridges help elephants grind course vegetation. Most mammals replace cheek teeth (premolars and molars) in a vertical manner. The new tooth develops and replaces the old one, from above in the upper jaw and from below in the lower jaw. In elephants, the replacement of the cheek teeth is a horizontal process. New teeth develop at the back of the mouth and progress forward until worn out at the front. Each molar tooth is about the size of a brick and weighs between 1.8 and 2.0 kg (4-4.5 lb.). Elephant molar teeth are replaced six times during its lifetime. Elephants are born with temporary incisors (tusks) that are replaced with permanent ones between six and 13 months of age. Permanent tusks grow continuously at a rate of about 17 cm (6.7 in.) per year, reaching lengths of up to 3.5 m (7.7 ft.) for adult African male elephants. The upper one-third of an elephant's tusk, where it is embedded in the bone of the upper jaw, is mostly hollow and carries a single nerve. The top third embedded portion of the tusk functions as an anchor when digging and uprooting vegetation and aids defense. Elephant ivory is distinguished from other animal dentition by its unique cross section patterning. An elephant tusk cross section shows diamond-shaped striations, called 'engine turning' and is unique to elephants. Similar to humans, elephants may be 'left or right-handed,' meaning there is a preference to use one tusk over the other. As a result, one tusk may be more worn than the other.",
        Nose: "Hair:",
        nose:"Elephants have sparse hair distributed unevenly on their body, with the most noticeable concentrations around the eyes, ear openings, chin, and tail. Young elephants are hairier than adults and their hair is reddish-brown in color. As they mature, the amount of hair is reduced and becomes darker.",
        hand:"Foot:",
        feet:"The skeleton of an elephant's foot is angled, with a large pad of fat and connective tissue at the heel. The angled foot structure means that elephants walk on their tiptoes with their body weight evenly distributed across the fatty/connective tissue at the heel. Ex: An adult male Asian elephant that is 2.88 m (9.5 ft.) in height and weighs about 4,167 kg (9,259 lb.) distributes just 3.8 kg (8.5 lb.) of weight per square inch on its heels. The elephant's unique foot structure enables secure movement over uneven terrain and swampy ground.",
        Senses:"Senses:-",
        hear:"Hearing:",
        hearing:"Elephants have good hearing, detecting sounds as low as 14 to 16 hz (human low range: 20 hz) and as high as 12,000 hz (human high range: 20,000). Elephants frequently use infrasonic sounds, which are sounds emitted below the human hearing range, in long-distance communication. Research has shown that elephants are capable of recognizing calls and voices of particular individuals from 1 to 1.5 km (0.6-0.9 mi.) away. Refer to Communication Section. The ears of the elephant are used to funnel in sound waves from the environment, contributing to its keen sense of hearing. In general, animals with large heads and wide-set ears are better adapted for hearing lower frequency sounds because the larger skull encompasses longer ear canals, wider tympanic membranes (membrane that separates the middle ear from the exterior), and larger middle ears.",
        eye:"Vision:",
        Eyesight:"Elephant eyes are about 3.8 cm (1.5 in.) in diameter and their vision is moderate. Elephants traverse forests, savannas, and grasslands, primarily orienting with the trunk, as opposed to sight. Ex: There have been documented occurrences of elephant herds being led by a blind member. The complete lack of vision did not hinder the blind member’s ability to fulfill its leadership role. Elephants have long eyelashes to help avert blowing sand, dirt, and debris from the eyes. In addition to the upper and lower eyelids, elephants have a “third eyelid” which moves vertically across the eye. These eyelids function to protect the eye when feeding, bathing, and dusting (cooling down). Refer to behavior section. Some elephants develop a white ring that encircles the iris as they mature. This ring is similar to an age-ring that may develop in humans (as they age) called arcus lipoides, and does not affect vision. The eyes of an elephant are located on the sides of the head and therefore provide better peripheral vision (angle of vision extending from the sides to the rear), rather than binocular vision (eyes located on the front of the face, in which fields of vision overlap, creating depth perception).",
        Smell:"Olfactory:",
        smell:"Elephants have a keen sense of smell, detecting water sources up to 19.2 km (12 mi.) away. Nostrils are located at the tip of the trunk and function in breathing, smelling, and drawing water in to squirt into the mouth. The elephants’ sense of smell is in constant use, with the trunks moving back and forth, detecting new scents and information. Once a scent is drawn in through thee nostrils, there is a series of seven olfactory turbinals, located in the nasal cavity. Turbinals are curls of bone that have millions of olfactory receptor cells associated with them. If smelling does not provide enough information, elephants may collect the substance with the trunk. Then the chemical information is passed on to its Jacobson’s organ, a chemical detection unit located in the soft tissue of the upper palate (roof of the mouth). The organ is attached to the oral/nasal cavities and primarily functions to detect the estrus (reproductive) status of a female. This behavior is known as the flehmen response and is characterized by the elephant curling its trunk into its mouth.",
        Taste:"Touch:",
        taste:"The trunk is one of the most tactile appendages elephants have. It is used to stroke, touch, explore, caress, or reassure in care-taking and may also be used to slap or block in defense or dominance situations. The trunk is so sensitive to touch that it is capable of perceiving pressure differences as light 0.25 mm (0.01 in.) in depth, which is equivalent to a light brush against the skin. The strength of an elephant’s trunk is capable of lifting weights in excess of 250 kg (550 lb.). Elephant trunks have extensive sensory motor cells, called pacinian corpuscles, that enable them to have a strong sense of touch. The pacinian corpuscles are composed of concentric membranes of connective tissue, similar to the layers of an onion. Between each layer of connective tissue is a slimy gel. When a movement or vibration is detected, the pressure deforms the gel and connective tissue layers of the pacinian corpuscles. This stimulates nerve endings and sends a signal to the brain. Many animals including elephants survived the Asian tsunami in 2004. It is thought these animals had advanced warning to the tsunami due to their detection of seismic vibrations. The tsunami’s approaching vibrations were detected by the pacinian corpuscles in the elephant’s feet and alerted them to the approaching storm.",
        Behavior:"Behavior:-",
        Observation:"Social Structure:",
        observation:"The social structure of elephants is complex, varying by gender, and population dynamics. Adult elephants form matriarchal (female-led) societies. Adult males are usually solitary. Adult male elephants are solitary in nature but may associate with other bulls (adult males) in small, unstable groups. Males will leave the family unit (natal unit) between 12 and 15 years of age. Although primarily solitary in nature, bulls will associate with non-natal family units (family units to which they are not related). Bulls do not have preferences for specific family units and will randomly move to different groupings daily and even hourly looking for reproductively receptive females. The bulls' nomadic (wandering) social system allows them to maximize reproductive potential. With this system, a single bull can potentially find up to 30 mates in a year, as opposed to fathering four calves in three years, if he associates with only one family unit.",
        Social:"Social Behavior:",
        social:"Bulls assess each other’s strength through sparring or play-fighting. The level of dominance is closely related to a bull's size, power, and weight. As bulls mature, these characteristics increase. Bulls that are in musth are particularly dominant and non-musth bulls and younger males avoid confrontations with them. Refer to musth section. The complex nature of elephant social structure is extended into the mourning behavior for deceased companions. When elephants come across deceased remains of other elephants, a silent pause is taken, as the remains are touched with their trunks. Occasionally tusks or bones are carried with them, as the herd continues to travel. Elephants are not territorial. The home range is between 10 and 70 km2 (four to 27 mi.2) and possibly larger, depending on herd size and seasonality.",
        Individual:"Individual Behaviors:",
        individual:"Elephants have a musth gland located just beneath the skin's surface, halfway between the eye and ear, on each side of their head. Annually, musth glands secrete a dark, oily, musky substance and become inflamed. This physiological change is associated with a behavior observed in male elephants called musth, and is characterized by unpredictable, dominant, and excitable behavior. The musth period lasts between several days to several months. There is no seasonal pattern with musth. Bulls come into it a different times. Elephants sleep about approximately four hours a night. About two hours of that are spent standing. During deep sleep, individuals lie on their sides, breathing noisily, and sometimes snoring. Elephants are crepuscular in nature, primarily active at dawn and dusk (twilight hours) when the environment is cooler.",
        Food:"Diet:",
        Intake:"Elephants eat between 149 and 169 kg (330-375 lb.) of vegetation daily. Sixteen to eighteen hours, or nearly 80% of an elephant’s day is spent feeding. Elephants consume grasses, small plants, bushes, fruit, twigs, tree bark, and roots. Tree bark is a favorite food source for elephants. It contains calcium and roughage, which aids digestion. Tusks are used to carve into the trunk and tear off strips of bark. Elephants require about 68.4 to 98.8 L (18 to 26 gal.) of water daily, but may consume up to 152 L (40 gal.). An adult male elephant can drink up to 212 L (55 gal.) of water in less than five minutes. To supplement the diet, elephants will dig up earth to obtain salt and minerals. The tusks are used to churn the ground. The elephant then places dislodged pieces of soil into its mouth, to obtain nutrients. Frequently these areas result in holes that are several feet deep and vital minerals are made accessible to other animals. Ex: Over time, African elephants have hollowed out deep caverns in a volcano mountainside on the Ugandan border, to obtain salt licks and minerals. Hills have been carved by Asian elephants in India and Sumatra searching for salt and minerals. These carved areas in the landscape provide valuable food and shelter resources for a diverse array of native wildlife."

        link: "",
        habitat: "Habitat:",
        detail: "Bony fishes live in fresh water, sea water, and brackish (a combination of fresh water and salt water) environments. The salinity of sea water is about 35 ppt (parts per thousand). Some specias can tolerate higher-salinity environments. Some species of gobies can tolerate salinity levels as high as 60 ppt. Fishes live in virtually all aquatic habitats. Different species of fish are adapted for different habitats: rocky shores, coral reefs, kelp forests, rivers and streams, lakes and ponds, under sea ice, the deep sea, and other environments of fresh, salt, and brackish water. Some species of bony fishes can survive freezing temperatures of the Arctic and Antarctic. Certain glycoprotein molecules present in the blood of these specially-adapted fishes lower the freezing point of the blood. The arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) can survive temperatures as low as -2°C (28°F). In general, fishes rely on oxygen dissolved in water for respiration. Some species of bony fishes require large amounts of dissolved oxygen. The brown trout (Salmo trutta) requires up to 11 mg of dissolved oxygen per liter (11 ppm, or parts per million).",
        distribution: "Distribution:",
        details:"Bony fishes inhabit almost every body of water. They are found in tropical, temperate, and polar seas as well as virtually all fresh water environments. Some species of bony fishes live as deep as 11 km (6.8 mi.) in the deep sea. Other species inhabit lakes as high as 5 km (3.1 mi.) above sea level. About 58% of all species of bony fishes (more than 13,000 species) live in marine environments. Although only 0.01% of the earth's water is fresh water, freshwater fishes make up about 42% of fish species (more than 9,000 species).",
         migration:"Migration:",
        Detail: "Most bony fishes have small home ranges. Some species of bony fishes migrate great distances. Food and habitat availability, reproduction, environmental cycles and temperature change may be causes of migration for some species. Almost all tuna species are migratory. Albacore (Thunnus alalunga) migrate across the Pacific Ocean from the coast of California to the coast of Japan, more than 8,500 km (5,270 mi.). Data from albacore tagging studies indicate that they travel an average of 26 km (16 mi.) per day. Tagged northern bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) have migrated 7,700 km (4,774 mi.) across the Atlantic Ocean in 119 days, about 65 km (40 mi.) per day. Billfishes (family Istiophoridae) are highly migratory. A black marlin (Makaira indica) that was tagged and released off Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, was recovered off Norfolk Island in the South Pacific, more than 10,680 km (6,622 mi.) away. Some bony fish species are diadromous: they migrate between fresh and marine environments. Some fish are catadromous: they live in freshwater environments but migrate downriver to the ocean to spawn. The freshwater eels (family Anguillidae) develop in marine environments then move into freshwater rivers to live. Anadromous fishes live most of their lives in the ocean, but migrate into freshwater environments to spawn. The sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) may travel more than 3,600 km (2,232 mi.) up the Yukon River to spawn.",
        size: "Size:-",
        Size:"Thousands of species of bony fishes are less than a few centimeters long as adults. Among the smallest is the endangered dwarf pygmy goby (Pandaka pygmaea). Adult males reach just 15 mm (0.6 in.), and adult females reach only about 9 mm (0.4 in.). Some species can reach tremendous sizes - much larger than a human. The longest bony fish is the oarfish (Regalecus glesne), which can reach 11 m (36 ft.). Among the heaviest of the bony fishes is the common ocean sunfish (Mola mola), which lives throughout warm and temperate seas worldwide. A large sunfish can reach 3.3 m (10.8 ft.) and 2,300 kg (5,071 lb.). Black marlin (Makaira indica) reach 4.7 m (15.4 ft.) and 750 kg (1,653 lb.). The European wels catfish (Silurus glanis) reaches 5 m (16.4 ft.) and about 300 kg (661 lb.). ",
        body:"Body Shape:",
        Shape:"Bony fishes show great variety in body shape, but the 'typical' fish body shape is roughly cylindrical and tapering at both ends. This characteristic fusiform shape is quite energy efficient for swimming. Compared to other body shapes, this body shape creates less drag (the opposing force an object generates as it travels through water). The body shape of some species differs from or combines features of these typical fish body forms. Examples include boxfishes (family Ostraciidae ), ocean sunfishes (family Molidae), seahorses (Hippocampus spp.), the weedy seadragon (Phyllopteryx taeniolatus), and the leafy seadragon (Phycodurus eques).",
        Coloration: "Coloration:",
        Color :"Most fish species have pigmentation. Pigment is mostly contained in cells called chromatophores. Most fishes can contract and expand their chromatophores to change colors. Reflective cells called iridocytes can change color rapidly. Because the different wavelengths of light are absorbed at various depths, fishes may appear a different color underwater than at the surface. Some fish, such as the ghost glass catfish (Kryptopterus bicirrhis), lack pigmentation. Some fishes show disruptive coloration. Their colors and pattern obscure the outline of the fish by contradicting the animal's body shape. Highly distinctive elements may confuse predators. For example, some fish have a false eyespot that can fool a predator into striking in the wrong direction, allowing the fish to escape.",
         Head:"Head:",
        head:"Eye size and position vary depending on the habitat and behavior of the species. Some species have eyes positioned for a field of vision below or above their bodies. The South American catfish (family Hypophthalmidae) has eyes directed downward. Many species, including the sand divers (family Dactyloscopidae) have eyes directed toward the surface. In flatfishes in the order Pleuronectiformes, one eye migrates across the top of their skull during development. Very young juveniles are free-swimming and have an eye on each side of the head. Adults live on the sea bottom, lying and swimming on one side. The eye that would typically be on that side of the body is on the dorsal (top) of the fish, adjacent to the other eye. In most species, the gills are protected by a flexible plate called an operculum. Most bony fishes have a single pair of gill openings. Some bony fishes such as eels (family Anguillidae) have a pair of gill holes or pores that aren't covered by an operculum. The nostrils of most bony fishes have no connection with the mouth or gills. In some bony fishes (such as eels), the nostrils' incurrent and excurrent openings are widely separated.",
        Skin: "Scales:",
        skin : "Most species of bony fishes are covered with and protected by a layer of plates called scales. There are four different kinds of bony fish scales: cosmoid, ganoid, cycloid, and ctenoid. True cosmoid scales are found only on extinct Crossopterygians. The inner layer of a cosmoid scale is compact bone. On top of this bone layer lays a spongy layer and then a layer of cosmine (a type of dentin). The upper surface is enamel. The living coelacanth has modified cosmoid scales, which are thinner than true cosmoid scales. Gars (family Lepisosteidae), bichirs, and reedfishes (family Polypteridae) have ganoid scales. They are similar to cosmoid scales, but a layer of ganoin (a hard, enamel-like substance) lies over the cosmine layer and under the enamel. Ganoid scales are diamond-shaped, shiny, and hard.Most bony fishes have cycloid or ctenoid scales. Both cycloid and ctenoid scales consist of an outer layer of calcium and an inner layer of connective tissue. Cycloid scales overlap from head to tail, an arrangement that helps reduce drag as a fish swims. Cycloid scales are circular and smooth. They are most common on fishes with soft fin rays. Ctenoid scales have a characteristic toothed edge. They are most common on fishes with spiny fin rays. As a fish grows, cycloid and ctenoid scales add concentric layers. Some bony fishes may have scales only on portions of their body, and some species have no scales.",
         Dentition:"Mucus:",
        dentition:"A fish secretes a layer of mucus that covers its entire body. Mucus helps protect a fish from infection. In some bony fishes, mucus may serve additional functions. Some species of parrotfishes (family Scaridae) envelop their bodies in mucous bubbles at night while they rest. This mucous barrier may 'hide' the parrotfish from nocturnal predators that rely on their sense of smell to locate prey. Young discus (Symphysodon discus) feed on the parent fish's mucus.",
        Nose: "Fins:",
        nose:"All fishes have fins. Bony fish families show various degrees of fin fusion and reduction. Fins help stabilize or propel a fish in the water. Except in the lungfishes and the coelacanth, fins lack bones. In Actinopterygians, fins are supported by structures called rays. Some bony fishes have soft, flexible fin rays. Other bony fishes have spiny, rigid fin rays at the leading edges of the dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins. Both soft and spiny fin rays are modified scales. The spiny fin rays of some species are associated with venom glands. Fishes in the family Scorpaenidae include the stonefish (Synanceja spp.), the lionfish (Pterois spp.), and the scorpionfish (Scorpaena spp.) - some of the most venomous fishes in the world. Glands in the dorsal, anal, and pelvic spines produce venom that is intensely painful and occasionally fatal to humans. The caudal fin, or tail, is responsible for propulsion in most bony fishes. Caudal fins come in many shapes. Many continuously swimming fishes have forked caudal fins. Fishes with lunate caudal fins, such as tunas, tend to be fast swimmers that can maintain rapid speed for long durations.",
        Senses:"Senses:-",
        hear:"Acoustic Senses:",
        hearing:"The ears of a bony fish function in equilibrium, detecting acceleration, and hearing. There are no external openings to the ears. Sound waves travel through soft tissue to the ears. (A fish's soft body tissue has about the same acoustic density as water). There is great variation in hearing sensitivity, bandwidth, and upper frequency limit among bony fish species. The hearing range of the cod Gadus morhua is about 2 to 500 Hz, with peak sensitivity near 20 Hz - probably typical for most bony fish species that lack the adaptations described below. In some bony fish species, the swim bladder is associated with adaptations for enhanced sound reception at higher frequencies. In some, the swim bladder lies against the ear and acts as an amplifier to enhance sound detection. In other species, such as goldfish (Carassius auratus), a series of small bones connects the swim bladder to the ear. The hearing range of the goldfish is about 5 to 2,000 Hz - with peak sensitivity near 400 Hz. Recently researchers have discovered that the American shad (Alosa sapidissima) and certain related species can detect sounds from 200 to 180,000 Hz. The researchers theorize that this ultrasonic hearing is an adaptation for avoiding echolocating dolphins, which typically produce clicks at about 100,000 Hz. In bony fishes, frequency range of sound production does not appear to be correlated with hearing sensitivity. Most species of bony fishes probably detect prey by sound. In water, sound travels more than four times the speed of sound through air.",
        eye:"Eyesight:",
        Eyesight:"Bony fishes have a basic vertebrate eye, with various structural adaptations. A bony fish's eye includes rods and cones. Bony fishes, especially those that live in shallow-water habitats, probably have color vision. Certain visual cells are specialized to particular wavelengths and intensities. In general, deep-water fishes have large eyes, allowing them to absorb as much light as possible in the dark. Shallow-water fishes generally have smaller eyes. The pupils of some species of bony fishes, such as eels, contract and dilate depending on light conditions. In most species of bony fishes, however, pupils can't contract or dilate. The water's surface can reflect up to 80% of light that strikes it. Bony fishes have large lenses to make the most of available light. In some species, the eye has a reflective layer called the tapetum lucidum behind the retina. The tapetum lucidum reflects light back through the retina a second time. The mudskipper (family Periophthalmidae) and several other species of bony fishes have excellent eyesight both above and below the surface of the water. The four-eyed fishes (family Anablepidae) swim at the water's surface. Their eyes lie at the water line and are adapted for seeing in air and in water. Separate retinae and an asymmetric lens allow these remarkable fish to focus on images above the water and on images under water simultaneously. The eyesight in some species of bony fishes may be well developed. Goldfish (Carassius auratus) have excellent visual acuity up to 4.8 m (16 ft.) away. Some species of bony fishes have no eyes. The blind cavefishes (family Amblyopsidae) have no vision perception. Other senses help them find prey. The blind goby (Typhlogobius californiensis) is born with eyes that degenerate as the goby matures.",
        Taste:"Taste:",
        taste:"Bony fishes have taste buds in their mouths. Some species have taste buds along the head and ventral side of the body. Taste perception hasn't been extensively studied in bony fishes. Some species can detect some sensations, such as salty, sweet, bitter, and acid stimuli. Taste may be responsible for the final acceptance or rejection of prey items.",
        Smell:"Smell:",
        smell:"Olfactory cells in the nasal sac detect tiny amounts of chemicals in solution. In general, the sense of smell is well developed in fishes. The nasal areas and extent of the sense of smell vary among species. Species of freshwater eels (family Anguillidae) may detect chemicals in extremely low dilutions. Eels may detect a substance when only three or four molecules have entered the nasal sac. Studies suggest that smell guides at least some species of salmons (family Salmonidae) to their home streams during the breeding season. Some species can detect pheromones, chemical substances released by an animal that influence the behavior of members of the same species. Fishes may release pheromones during the breeding season or when alarmed.",
        Communication:"Communication:-",
        Sound:"Sound Production:",
        Production:"Many bony fishes produce sound, sometimes in association with reproductive, social, territorial, or aggressive behavior. Depending on the species, a bony fish can produce sound by rubbing its teeth together, vibrating its swim bladder, or by flexing and contracting muscles. Most sounds produced by bony fishes are below 10,000 Hz.",

        Social:"Swimming:",
        social:"Most species of bony fishes propel themselves with the caudal fin, but many species use other fins for propulsion. Among the slowest-swimming bony fishes are the eels.

         Individual:"Territorial Behavior:",
        individual:"Various species of bony fishes have sharply contrasting territorial behavior. Although damselfishes (family Pomacentridae) are relatively small, they are fearless in defending a territory. However, most large groupers (family Serranidae) will retreat from their territory if approached by another animal.",
        Eating:"Eating Habits:-",
        Food:"Food Intake:",
        Intake:"The amount of food a bony fish eats is directly related to its size, its metabolic rate, and the temperature of its environment. Smaller fishes generally have a higher metabolic rate than large fishes of the same species. Thus, small fishes generally eat proportionately more. Warm-water fishes generally require more food than similar-size cold-water fishes. A fish's body temperature - and its metabolic rate - is determined by the temperature of its environment. Some bony fishes can go long periods without eating. Some freshwater eels (Anguilla spp.) can survive more than a year without food. Some researchers have calculated food intake for some species. In one study, bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) - a species of small freshwater fish - ate between 1% and 35% of their body weight in food per week, depending on water temperature. Studies on anchovies (family Engraulidae) during the summer showed a food intake of about 8% to 10% of body weight per day.",

        habitat: "Habitat:",
        detail: "Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm temperate waters, adapting to several marine and estuarine habitats, including, occasionally, rivers. Habitat use is influenced by environmental heterogeneity; meaning these animals distribute through an ecosystem depending on factors like resources, depth, water temperature, sea-bed gradient and type of sediment. Scientists theorize that differing ecological characteristics throughout their range have led to differences between bottlenose dolphin populations. Because bottlenose dolphin populations have inshore and offshore distributions, scientists identify two ecotypes with anatomical, physiological, behavioral, ecological and genetic differences. For example, bottlenose dolphins in Scotland favor deeper areas than those from Florida, U.S., that prefer shallow waters of less than 3 m (9.8 ft.) depth.  Coastal dolphins generally form smaller cohesive groups (<20) than the offshore (>100). Inshore bottlenose dolphins are typically seen in bays, tidal creeks, inlets, marshes, rivers, and waters along the open ocean beach, often at depths of 3 m (9.8 ft.) or less. Some inshore ecotypes seem to be adapted for warm, shallow waters. Its smaller body and larger flippers suggest increased maneuverability and heat dissipation. The distribution/migration of prey correlated with seasonal changes in water temperature may account for the seasonal movements of some dolphins. Inshore bottlenose dolphins found in warmer waters show less extensive localized, seasonal movements and many have been observed staying within a limited, long-term home range, such as in Sarasota Bay, Florida. Adult males range more widely than females, often encompassing the ranges of several female bands. Dolphin communities may overlap providing for genetic exchange. These neighboring communities may be distinct in both behavior and genetics. In the Northwest Atlantic, researchers determined that bottlenose dolphins within 7.5 km (4.65 mi.) from shore were coastal ecotypes. Dolphins beyond 34 km (21mi.) from shore were offshore ecotypes. They also observed that the two ecotypes overlap between those boundaries, and concluded that further habitat-use analysis must be done to explain that situation.  In the Gulf of California, coastal and offshore ecotypes differ in color, morphology, and group size. The coastal form is bigger, more robust, and with a lighter dorsal color than the offshore type. Its rostrum and pectoral flippers are shorter and groups are formed by <20 individuals. In this study, it was also seen that offshore bottlenose dolphins associate with sperm whales and have a similar trophic position with them (specifically females and juveniles). Dolphins benefit from this interaction by feeding on similar prey.",
        distribution: "Distribution:",
        details: "Bottlenose dolphins live in temperate and tropical waters worldwide. Distribution is generally limited to surface water temperatures of 10° to 32°C (50° to 90° F). In the Pacific Ocean, bottlenose dolphins are found from northern Japan to Australia and from Southern California to Chile. They are also found offshore in the eastern tropical Pacific as far west as the Hawaiian Islands. Off the California coast bottlenose dolphins have been observed as far north as Monterey, particularly during years of unusual warmth. In the Atlantic Ocean, bottlenose dolphins are found from Nova Scotia to Patagonia and from Norway to the tip of South Africa. They are the most abundant dolphin species along the United States' coast from Cape Cod through the Gulf of Mexico. Bottlenose dolphins are also found in the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins are found in the Indian Ocean from Indonesia to Australia to South Africa, the Red Sea, and in the tropical and subtropical waters of the western Pacific.",
        migration:"Migration:",
        Detail: "Variations in water temperature, movements of food fish, and feeding habits may account for the seasonal movements of some dolphins to and from certain areas. Some coastal dolphins in higher latitudes show a clear tendency toward seasonal migrations, traveling farther south in the winter. For example, coastal bottlenose dolphins on the Atlantic side of the U.S. migrate seasonally between New Jersey and North Carolina. Coastal dolphins in warmer waters show less extensive, localized seasonal movements. Some coastal animals stay within a limited home range: an area in which individuals or groups regularly move about during day-to-day activities. Individual dolphins that live within a home range are called 'local residents'. Resident dolphins have been identified along the coasts of Georgia, Florida, Texas, southern California, Gulf of California, and South Africa. Groups of dolphins that reside within a home range make up 'resident communities'. The Sarasota, Florida resident dolphin community home range is an area of about 125 km2 (48.3 mi2). Home ranges may overlap.",
        population:"Population:",
        Details: "Bottlenose dolphins are not endangered or threatened. The worldwide population of common bottlenose dolphins is about 600,000. Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins are abundant, but the overall population is unknown. Chromosome banding techniques have proven useful in bottlenose dolphin population studies. In some areas, scientists can identify individuals and determine relationships among dolphins in a group.",
        size: "Size:-",
        Size:"In general, bottlenose dolphins are 2 to 3.9 m (6.6 to 12.8 ft.). Their average weight is 150 to 200 kg (331.5 to 442 lbs.). Maximum length and weight reported in the wild was from an individual in the Eastern North Atlantic that measured 4.1 m (13.5 ft.) and 650 kg (1,400 lbs.). A wild individual from the Western North Atlantic weighed 284 kg (626 lbs.). The average adult length of dolphins in Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums facilities is 2.59 m (8.5 ft.). The average adult length in the wild is 2.2 to 2.7 m (7.2 to 8.9 ft.). Coastal bottlenose dolphins measured off Sarasota, Florida average 2.5 to 2.7 m (8.2 to 8.9 ft.) and weigh between 190 and 260 kg (419 to 573 lbs.). Large bottlenose dolphins in the Pacific may be 3.7 m (12 ft.) and weigh 454 kg (1,000 lbs.). In the Mediterranean, bottlenose dolphins can grow to 3.7 m (12 ft.) or more. ",
        body:"Body Shape:",
        Shape:"A bottlenose dolphin has a sleek, streamlined, fusiform body.",
        Coloration: "Pectoral Flippers:",
        Color :"A dolphin's forelimbs are pectoral flippers. Pectoral flippers have the major skeletal elements of land mammal forelimbs, but they are foreshortened and modified. The skeletal elements are rigidly supported by connective tissue. Pectoral flippers are curved back slightly and pointed at the tips. Pectoral flipper length averages 30 to 50 cm (11.7 to 19.5 in.). Dolphins use their pectoral flippers mainly to steer and, with the help of the flukes, to stop. Blood circulation in the flippers adjusts to help maintain body temperature. Arteries in the flippers are surrounded by veins. Thus, some heat from the blood traveling through the arteries is transferred to the venous blood rather than the environment. This countercurrent heat exchange aids dolphins in conserving body heat. To shed excess body heat, circulation increases in veins near the surface of the flippers and decreases in veins returning to the body core.",
         Head:"Head:",
        head:"The rounded region of a dolphin's forehead is called the melon. The melon contains fat and plays an important role in dolphin echolocation. A bottlenose dolphin has a well-defined rostrum (snout-like projection) in front of the melon. The rostrum is typically 7 to 8 cm (3 in.) long, marked by a lateral crease.",
         Skin: "Skin:",
        skin : "Bottlenose dolphins have a few, sparse hair follicles around the tip of their rostrum, though any individual hairs that are present fall out before or shortly after birth.  Dolphin skin is highly specialized and plays an important role in hydrodynamics. Upon close observation, cutaneous ridges may be seen on the surface of a dolphin’s skin that run circumferentially around the body trunk and vary in direction past the dorsal fin and other isolated areas. Cutaneous ridges may play an important role in sensory function and in drag reduction as a dolphin swims. A dolphin’s skin is smooth and feels rubbery. The skin has no hair or sweat glands. The outer skin layer (epidermis) is about 15 to 20 times thicker than the epidermis of humans. Dolphin skin constantly flakes and peels as new skin cells replace old cells. A bottlenose dolphin's outermost skin layer may be replaced every 2 hours. This sloughing rate is 9 times faster than in humans. This turnover rate ensures a smooth body surface and probably helps increase swimming efficiency by reducing drag (resistance to movement).",
        Dentition:"Teeth:",
        dentition:"Teeth are conical and interlocking. Teeth are designed for grasping (not chewing) food. Bottlenose dolphins have 18 to 26 teeth on each side of the upper and lower jaws, a total of 72 to 104 teeth. A tooth's diameter measures about 1 cm (0.4 in.). Dolphin teeth are not replaced.",
        Nose: "Dorsal Fin:",
        nose:"A bottlenose dolphin's dorsal fin is often falcate (curved back), although the shape is quite variable. It is located at the center of the back. Like the flukes, the dorsal fin is made of dense, fibrous connective tissue, with no bone, cartilage, or muscle. As in the flukes and the flippers, arteries in the dorsal fin are surrounded by veins to help conserve or dissipate body heat. The dorsal fin may also help maintain balance as a dolphin swims, but is not necessarily essential. In fact, some whales and porpoises don’t have dorsal fins at all.",
        Senses:"Senses:-",
        hear:"Hearing:",
        hearing:"Hearing range. Bottlenose dolphins hear tones with a frequency up to 160 kHz with the greatest sensitivity ranging from 40 to 100 kHz. The average hearing range for humans is about 0.02 to 20 kHz. In other studies, the hearing range for the bottlenose dolphin has been measured in 75 to 150,000 Hz (0.075 to 150 kHz). The range of hearing of a young, healthy human is 15 to 20,000 Hz (0.015 to 20 kHz). Human speech falls within the frequency band of 100 to 10,000 Hz (0.1 to 10 kHz), with the main, useful voice frequencies within 300 to 3,400 Hz (0.3 to 3.4 kHz). This is well within a dolphin’s range of hearing. Dolphins have a well-developed, acute sense of hearing. The auditory cortex of the brain is highly developed. The dolphin's auditory nerve is about twice the diameter of the human eighth nerve (connecting the inner ear to the brainstem) leading to more rapid sound processing for dolphins. In addition, a dolphin's auditory nerve supply is about three times that of humans — possibly providing more ultrasonic information to a dolphin's central nervous system for echolocation.",
         eye:"Eyesight:",
        Eyesight:"Dolphins have acute vision both in and out of the water. A dolphin's eye is particularly adapted for seeing under water. Bottlenose dolphins have a double slit pupil allowing for similar visual acuity in air and water. Their eyes are adapted to mitigate varying light intensities. Studies show that the visual acuity of dolphins is similar or below the range of many terrestrial animals. There is currently no reference that measures distance of visual capability. In air, certain features of the lens and cornea correct for the refraction of light caused by the transition from aquatic to aerial vision. Without this adaptation, a dolphin would be nearsighted in air. A dolphin's retinas contain both rod cells and cone cells, indicating that they may have the ability to see in both dim and bright light. (Rod cells respond to lower light levels than cone cells.) Researchers theorize that all modern cetaceans, including all toothed whales, lack S-cone cells and therefore aren't able to discriminate color in the blue wavelengths. Dolphins' eyes have a well-developed tapetum lucidum, a light-reflecting layer that reflects light through the retina a second time, adapting their vision to low-light levels. Dolphins are primarily monocular (using one eye to process visual stimuli), but also possess the capability for binocular vision (when both eyes are coordinated for vision). Evidence suggest that bottlenose dolphins use their right eye predominantly for approaching and investigation when processing visual information.",
        Taste:"Taste:",
        taste:"Little is known about a toothed whale's sense of taste. They do have taste buds at the base of the tongue, although they haven't been well studied. One research study showed that bottlenose dolphins can distinguish chemicals such as citric acid. In zoological parks, whales and dolphins show strong preferences for specific food fishes. Three studies indicated that taste buds may be found within 5 to 8 pits at the back of the tongue. One study found them in young dolphins and not adults. Another study could not trace a nerve supply to the taste buds. Regardless, behavioral studies indicate bottlenose dolphins have some type of chemosensory capacity within the mouth. Behavioral evidence suggests that bottlenose dolphins can detect 3 or 4 primary tastes (sweet, bitter, sour, salty), but the way they use their ability to “taste” is still unclear. ",
        Smell:"Smell:",
        smell:"Olfactory lobes of the brain and olfactory nerves are absent in all toothed whales, indicating that they may not have a sense of smell.",
        Communication:"Communication:-",
        Sound:"Sound Production:",
        Production:"A human vocalizes (makes sound) by exhaling — our lungs force air through our larynx. Vocal cords in the larynx vibrate as air flows across them, producing sounds. Our throat, tongue, mouth, and lips shape these sounds into speech. A dolphin does not have vocal cords in its larynx. Sounds are probably produced by air movements in the nasal passage. Technological advances in bioacoustic research enable scientists to better explore the nasal region. Studies suggest that a tissue complex in the nasal region is probably the most likely site of all sound production. This complex, called the dorsal bursa, includes 'phonic lips' — structures that project into the nasal passage. As air pushes through the nasal passage and past the phonic lips, the surrounding tissue vibrates, producing sound. A dolphin has two dorsal bursa/phonic lip complexes, which can operate independently and simultaneously. Bottlenose dolphins can produce both clicks and whistles at the same time. During some vocalizations, bottlenose dolphins actually release air from the blowhole, but scientists believe that these bubble trails and clouds are a visual display and not necessary for producing sound. The frequency of the sounds produced by a bottlenose dolphin ranges from 0.2 to 150 kHz. The lower frequency vocalizations (about 0.2 to 50 kHz) are likely used in social communication. Social signals have their most energy at frequencies less than 40 kHz. Higher frequency clicks (40 to 150 kHz) are primarily used for echolocation.",
        Language:"Signature Whistles:",
        language:"A bottlenose dolphin identifies itself with a signature whistle. The signature whistle is so distinct that scientists can identify individual dolphins by looking at their whistle shapes on a sonogram.  They use these unique whistles to communicate, identity, location and, potentially, emotional state. Dolphins have been observed using signature whistles to cooperate with one another, address other individuals, facilitate mother-calf reunions and, possibly, to broadcast affiliation with other individuals. Signature whistle frequencies typically range from 7 to 15 kHz and last less than one second. A mother dolphin may whistle to her calf almost continuously for several days after giving birth. This acoustic imprinting helps the calf learn to identify its mother. A dolphin develops its signature whistle as young as one month old. Dolphins may mimic each other's signature whistles and scientists have hypothesized that dolphins use the whistles for social interaction. Scientists have found no evidence of a dolphin language.",
        Behavior:"Behavior:-",
        Observation:"Social Organization:",
        observation:"Bottlenose dolphins live in fluid social groups. In the past, bottlenose dolphin groups have been referred to as pods — social groups of unchanging composition. More recently, long-term studies of bottlenose dolphins have now shown that their group composition changes. Coastal bottlenose dolphins are primarily found in groups of 2 to 15 individuals. The associations of the animals are fluid, often repeated but not constant. Solitary coastal animals are observed in various regions of the world. In general, group size tends to increase with water depth and openness of habitat. This may correlate with foraging strategies and protection. Some group members establish strong social bonds. Bottlenose dolphins show aggression and establish and maintain dominance through posturing, biting, chasing, jaw clapping, smacking their tails on the water, emitting bubble clouds from their blowholes, and impact through body slamming in the most severe cases. Dolphins often show aggression by raking — scratching one another with their teeth, leaving superficial lacerations that soon heal. Traces of light parallel stripes remain on the dolphin's skin. These marks have been seen in virtually all dolphin species.",
        Social:"Daily Activity Cycles:",
        social:"Bottlenose dolphins are active to some degree both day and night. Observations indicate that dolphins undergo daily cycles of activity, which include feeding, socializing, traveling, and resting. Social behavior comprises a major portion of bottlenose dolphins' daily activities. Feeding usually peaks in the early morning and late afternoon. Daily activity cycles are influenced by both environmental factors (habitat, time of year, time of day) and physiological factors.",
        Individual:"Individual Behaviors:",
        individual:"Dolphins frequently ride on the bow waves or the stern wakes of boats. This activity is probably adapted from the natural behavior of riding ocean swells, the wakes of large whales, or a mother dolphin's slip stream (hydrodynamic wake). Dolphins have been seen jumping as high as 4.9 m (16 ft) from the surface of the water and landing on their backs, bellies, or sides in a behavior called a breach. Both young and old dolphins chase one another, carry objects around, toss seaweed to each other, and use objects to solicit interaction. Such activity may be practice for catching food. At SeaWorld, dolphins have been observed using objects like fish in seemingly playful ways. They even use air forced out of their blowholes as a form of play.  A young bottlenose dolphin at Dolphin Cove has learned how to create and control bubble rings of air to play with.",
        protection:"Protection and Care:",
        care:"Large adult males often roam the periphery of a group, and may afford some protection against predators. Researchers have observed scouting behavior in bottlenose dolphins. An individual may investigate novel objects or unfamiliar territories and 'report' back to the group. Bottlenose dolphins may aid ill or injured dolphins. They may stand by and vocalize, or they may physically support the animal at the surface so it can breathe.",
        Eating:"Eating Habits:-",
        Food:"Food Intake:",
        Intake:"Adult bottlenose dolphins eat approximately 4% to 6% of their body weight in food per day. A nursing mother's daily intake is considerably higher — about 8%. A dolphin's stomach is compartmentalized for rapid digestion."

For Example: fin whales, minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), sei whales (Balaenoptera borealis), blues whales (Balaenoptera musculus), and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) have worldwide distributions. Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni) are found throughout the tropics and subtropics.",

        Detail: "Most baleen whales are highly migratory, moving toward high-latitude (polar) feeding areas in the summer and toward low-latitude (tropical) calving areas in the winter.Many factors may act as environmental cues to help baleen whales navigate along a migration route: sun orientation, topography of the ocean floor, water temperature, chemical changes in the water, and magnetic sensing. Satellite-tracking studies assist scientists researching migratory behavior of baleen whales. Most baleen whales migrate 3,000–5,000 km (1,800–3,000 mi.) each way, depending on the species. Gray whales migrate more than 10,000 km (6,000 mi.) each way – the longest known migration for any mammal. Some species migrate much shorter distances. For example, Bryde's whales only move from temperate regions to the equator. And sei whales don't migrate as far toward the poles as most species do.",

The table below lists the most current estimates available. As a management tool, scientists categorize a geographically isolated and genetically distinct group of whales as a whale stock. Thus, a species may be represented by several stocks. For some species, certain stocks are depleted, while worldwide population numbers remain high. More than 800,000 minke whales are found worldwide, yet scientists consider the West Greenland stock depleted. Most of the total current population of bowhead whales survives in only one of five stocks. The other four face extinction. Certain stocks are recovering due to international protection from commercial whaling. Most notably, the gray whale population appears to have reached pre-whaling numbers.",

In general, females are about 5 percent longer than males of the same species.Baleen whales of the northern hemisphere are usually slightly smaller than their counterparts in the southern hemisphere. And some whale stocks can be larger or smaller than other stocks of the same species. For example, sei whales reach 20 m (65 ft) in the southern hemisphere, 18.6 m (61 ft) in the North Pacific, and 17.3 m (57 ft) in the North Atlantic. The largest whale–in fact, the largest animal, living or extinct–is the blue whale. Average length for Antarctic blue whales is about 25 m (82 ft.) for males and 27 m (89 ft.) for females. (Note: this average does not include measurements taken for a possible 'pygmy' subspecies, (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda). Blue whales in the northern hemisphere are slightly smaller. Record size for a blue whale–for a specimen taken during the whaling years–is 34 m (112 ft.). Another record-size individual weighed 190,000 kg (419,000 lbs.). Pygmy right whales are among the smallest baleen whales. Adult females reach lengths of 6.5 m (21 ft.), and adult males may reach 6.1 m (20 ft.). This species is rarely recorded, so details of its size are poorly documented.",

When lighting is from above, the animal appears inconspicuous. Blue whales are named for a steel blue-gray skin color. Minke, humpback, bowhead, and fin whales are distinctively colored. Northern hemisphere minke whales have a band of white across the otherwise black flippers. Individuals in the southern hemisphere may or may not have the flipper band. Humpback whales are black or gray except for their flippers and the undersides of their flukes, which are white. Bowhead whales are dark gray to black except for a white chin.

A whale's lack of fur is an adaptation for more efficient swimming: fur or hair creates drag as an animal swims. A variety of parasites can infest a baleen whale's skin. Diatoms grow on the skin of some species, including the blue whale. The diatom layer creates an olive-colored film on the skin. Gray and humpback whales are heavily infested with external parasites. Barnacles and whale 'lice' (actually amphipods) attach to skin around the head, blowhole, genital area, and throat grooves. Barnacles feed on plankton in the water. Whale lice feed on whale skin and damaged tissue such as a wound.",

A whale's ears are adapted for hearing underwater, not in air. A baleen whale has a small external ear opening on each side of the head. Each ear opening leads to a narrow auditory canal that is completely plugged by a waxy substance. The anatomy of the baleen whale ear is somewhat typical of an ear adapted to hear low-frequency sounds.",
        eye:"Eyesight:",

Underwater, the cornea isn't able to adequately focus waves into the lens because the refractive index of water is similar to that of the interior of the eye. The eye of a marine mammal compensates for this lack of refraction at the cornea interface by having a much stronger, spherical lens. It is more similar to the lens of a fish’s eye than the lens of a land mammal's eye. The retina of a baleen whale's eyes contains mostly 'rod cells', which are sensitive to low intensity light. 'Cone cells', which distinguish between different colors and are most sensitive to bright light, are less abundant. A whale's eyes are constantly bathed in water. There are no tear ducts, but glands at the outer cornea and eyelids secrete an oily substance that lubricates and cleans the eyes.",

Researchers speculate that these loud sounds may be for long-range contact, assembly, advertisement for mates, greeting, location, orientation, threat, navigation, or individual identification. Research is ongoing.). Humpback whales also produce a series of repeating units of sounds (up to 8,000 Hz) that are classified as 'songs'. (Songs are produced by males, and only while in breeding grounds. More analysis is needed before the function of whale songs is understood, and any adaptive advantages of singing are as yet unknown. Experts speculate that such vocalizations may keep males spaced apart; attract females; make it possible for whales to locate each other; or communicate information such as species, sex, location, mate status, and readiness to compete with other males for mates.

        Observation:"Behavior Observation:",
        observation:"For the most part, whales are visible only when at the surface breathing – less than 20% of the time – so it is inherently challenging to document and study whale behavior.",
        Social:"Social Behavior:",
        social:"Baleen whales are generally found singly or in loose associations, not in large groups or families. Exceptions include migrating baleen whales, which may be found in small groups of several individuals, and large numbers of individuals that may congregate in feeding or calving areas. All species of baleen whales establish strong mother/calf bonds. In fact, the strongest apparent bond between two individuals is between a calf and its mother. Mother and calf stay in close physical contact throughout the nursing period. A mother baleen whale stays close to her calf and attentively directs its movements. The baby swims close to its mother and is carried in the mother's 'slip stream', a type of hydrodynamic wake that develops as the mother swims. A mother whale may teach her calf certain behaviors. Whalers noted that female whales became aggressive when protecting their young.",
        Individual:"Individual Behaviors:",
        individual:"Research into baleen whale behavior is ongoing. Some behaviors may be interpreted as being related to food-gathering, aggression, excitement, warning, visual inspection, or mating. Some baleen whales slap their pectoral flippers, tail flukes, or head on the surface of the water, which creates loud sounds under water. Whale watchers and researchers have named certain common whale behaviors. A breach is a behavior in which a whale powerfully thrusts a large part of its body out of the water and lands on the surface - usually on its side or on its back - with a huge splash. Sometimes the same whale will breach several times in sequence.",
        Eating:"Eating Habits:-",
        Food:"Food Intake:",
        Intake:"Most baleen whales spend about four to six months in the summer feeding intensively in high-latitude, productive waters. They spend the next six to eight months traveling and breeding. A blue whale eats up to 3,600 kg (8,000 lbs.) of krill each day for about 120 days. It is estimated to take 1,000 kg (2,200 lbs.) of food to fill a blue whale’s stomach. Gray whales eat about 150,000 kg (340,000 lbs.) of food during a 130 to 140 day feeding period--a daily average intake of about 1,089 kg (2,400 lbs.). It is estimated to take 300 kg (660 lbs.) of food to fill a gray whale's stomach. Gray whales gain about 16% to 30% of their total body weight during a feeding season. A baleen whale's thick blubber layer stores fat; it is an energy reserve that is necessary during the traveling and breeding seasons."

        habitat: "Habitat:",
        detail: "The flamingo's most characteristic habitats are large alkaline or saline lakes or estuarine lagoons that usually lack vegetation. Lakes may be far inland or near the sea. A variety of habitats are used by flamingos: mangrove swamps, tidal flats, and sandy islands in the intertidal zone. The presence or absence of fish may have a great influence on the use of lakes by some flamingos. The Chilean flamingo is scarce or absent in lakes with fish. It is present, usually in large numbers, where there are no fish with which to compete for food. The introduction of fish to some lakes may seriously affect the distribution of the Chilean flamingo as well as the greater and Caribbean flamingos, since they all feed primarily on invertebrates. Other flamingo species are not affected because of different food sources.",
        distribution: "Distribution:",
        details: "All flamingos are found in tropical and subtropical areas. Populations of Chilean flamingos are found in central Peru, both coasts of southern South America (mainly in the winter), Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru, Bolivia, and southern Brazil. Stragglers have been reported on the Falkland Islands and Ecuador. The lesser flamingo is primarily an African species. Populations are found in eastern, southwestern, and western Africa. In addition, a sizable population nests in India. Stragglers can be found as far north as southern Spain. The James' flamingo has the most restricted range of all flamingo species. They are found in southern Peru, northeastern Chile, western Bolivia, and northwestern Argentina. Andean flamingos are found in southern Peru, north-central Chile, western Bolivia, and northwestern Argentina. The Caribbean flamingo is found throughout the Caribbean ( Cuba, the Bahamas, the Yucatan, Turks and Caicos), the Galapagos Islands, and the northern part of coastal South America. The greater flamingo has the most widespread distribution of all flamingo species. Populations are found in northwest India, the Middle East, the western Mediterranean, and Africa. Limited numbers of this species can be found over much of northern Europe and eastward to Siberia.",
         migration:"Migration:",
        Detail: "Flamingos are generally non-migratory birds. However, due to changes in the climate and water levels in their breeding areas, flamingo colonies are not always permanent. When water levels rise, birds may search for more favorable sites. Drought conditions may force some flamingo populations to relocate. Most flamingos that migrate will return to their native colony to breed. However, some may join a neighboring colony. When flamingos migrate, they do so mainly at night. They prefer to fly with a cloudless sky and favorable tailwinds. They can travel approximately 600 km (373 miles) in one night at about 50 to 60 kph (31-37 mph). When traveling during the day, the flamingos fly at high altitudes, possibly to avoid predation by eagles. The movements of the greater flamingo population living in Carmarque in southern France have been closely monitored since 1977. Most flamingos that leave the colony go either southwest to winter in Spain, or southeast to winter in Tunisia and Turkey. The percentage of birds that travel east or west seems to depend on the direction of the prevailing winds in the birds' first autumn.",
         population:"Population:",
        Details: "The lesser flamingo is the most numerous of all flamingo species, with an estimated population of 1.5 to 2.5 million individuals. The second most numerous flamingo species is the greater flamingo. Exact numbers of these birds are difficult to assess because of their extensive range and migration patterns. The Chilean flamingo is the most numerous of the south American flamingos. Estimated total population is not more than 200,000 individuals, and the population is in a decline. The James' flamingo has an estimated population of 64,000 individuals. Estimated population of the Andean flamingo is 33,927 birds with a decreasing trend. In 1956, the Caribbean flamingo numbers were estimated at only 21,500. Since then, the population has increased to a current estimate of 850,000 to 880,000 birds and a stable trend.",

        Size:"The greater flamingo is the tallest flamingo, standing 120 to 150 cm (47-59 in.) and weighing up to 3.5 kg (7.7 lbs.). The lesser flamingo is the smallest flamingo, standing 80 cm (31.5 in.) and weighing only 2.5 kg (5.5 lbs.). Males reach full size between one-and-a-half and two years. The wingspan of flamingos ranges from 95 to 100 cm (37-39 in.) for the lesser flamingo to 140 to 165 cm (55-65 in.) for the greater flamingo. The Caribbean flamingo has a wingspan of 150 cm (59 in.).",
        Coloration: "Coloration:",
        Color :"Feather color varies with species, ranging from pale pink to crimson or vermilion. Caribbean flamingos have the brightest coloration: crimson or vermilion. The Chilean flamingo is pale pink. Feather coloration is derived from carotenoid pigments found in a flamingo's food. Male and female flamingo coloration is the same. Newly-hatched chicks are gray or white. Juveniles are grayish, taking approximately one to two years to obtain full adult coloration. Parents may lose some of their pink coloration while raising young. Coloration of a flamingo's legs and feet varies according to species - from yellow to orange or pink-red. The Andean flamingo is the only species that has yellow legs and feet.",
        Head:"Head:",
        head:"The eyes are located on either side of the head. Flamingo chicks have gray eyes for approximately the first year of life. Adult flamingos have yellow eyes. An adult flamingo's bill is black, pinkish, or cream-colored. Coloration varies according to species. The upper mandible is thin and flat, and functions like a lid to the lower mandible. The lower mandible is large and trough- or keel-shaped. Tooth-like ridges on the outside of a flamingo's bill help filter food from the water. Both the upper and lower mandibles contain two rows of a bristled, comb-like or hair-like structure called lamellae. When the mandibles come together, the lamellae of the upper and lower mandibles mesh. A flamingo's large, fleshy tongue is covered with bristle-like projections that help filter water and food particles through the lamellae.",
        Skin: "Feathers:",
        skin : "Adult feathers have a small, delicate, accessory feather arising from the main feather at the point where the quill merges into the shaft of the feather. This is called an aftershaft. There are 12 principal flight feathers located on each wing. These black feathers are visible when the wings are extended. Flamingos have 12 to 16 tail feathers. Contour feathers cover all of the body except the bill and scaled parts of the legs and feet. They protect the skin from damage and help streamline the flamingo for flight. Flamingos molt (shed and replace) their wing and body feathers at irregular intervals ranging from twice a year to once every two years. The molt is related to the breeding cycle. Molted feathers lose their color.",

        Social:"Social Behavior:",
        social:"Flamingos devote considerable time to collective displays before, during, and after breeding. Several hundred to several thousand flamingos are all involved simultaneously with ritualized postures and movements to synchronize breeding. Sometimes only one display is performed, but more often, a predictable sequence of displays are carried out. Not all flamingo species perform all of the described displays, and some perform the displays slightly different than described. Flamingo displays include the following: 'Head-flag' involves stretching the neck and head up as high as possible, with the bill pointing upwards, and then rhythmically turning the head from one side to the other. 'Wing-salute' is performed by spreading the wings for a few seconds, showing their striking contrasted colors, while the tail is cocked and neck outstretched. In the 'inverted wing-salute', the flamingo angles its head down, cocks its tail, and orients its body so that the tail is higher than the chest. The wings are then held partially open above the back with the black flight feathers pointing up and the bend in the wing pointing down. 'Twist-preen' entails the bird twisting its neck back and appearing to preen quickly, with its bill behind a partly open wing. 'Wing-leg stretch' involves the leg and wing on the same side stretched out and to the rear. 'Marching' is performed by a large group of flamingos that cluster together, stand erect, and then move in quick, synchronized steps in first one direction and then another.",
        Individual:"Individual Behaviors:",
        individual:"Flamingos spend most of the day feeding, preening (distributing oil from a gland at the base of their tail to their feathers for waterproofing), resting, and bathing. Breeding birds feed day or night. Non-breeding birds feed at night and spend the day sleeping or involved in activities such as preening and bathing. Flamingos spend about 15% to 30% of their time during the day preening. This is a large percentage compared to waterfowl, which preen only about 10% of the time. Flamingos preen with their bills. An oil gland near the base of the tail secretes oil that the flamingo distributes throughout its feathers. Flamingos swim readily and bathe in shallow fresh water, submerging the whole body.",

        Food:"Food Intake:",
        Intake:"Lesser flamingos eat an estimated 60 g (2.1 oz.) dry weight to fulfill their daily food requirements. Through slow-motion photography, researchers discovered that these birds pump water through their bills 20 times a second to filter their food. A much slower filtration rate was found in the Caribbean flamingos - only 4 to 5 times a second to filter out their daily food requirements of 270 g (9.5 oz.) dry weight."

Sleeper sharks (Somniosus spp.) stay in the chilly Arctic waters all year round. Bigeye houndsharks (Lago omanensis) have been found at the bottom of the Red Sea some 2,195 m (7,200 ft.) deep. Bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) can survive extremely well in fresh water. They have been known to travel 1,609 km (1,000 miles) up the Mississippi River to the state of Illinois until locks and dams blocked their path. They are still found in fresh water areas like Lake Nicaragua, Lake Ysabel in Guatemala, the Zambezi River in Africa, the Tigris River in Iraq and 255 km (160 miles) up the Atchafalgya River in Louisiana.",
         migration:"Migration:",
        Detail: "Shark migration is poorly studied. Not all species migrate. In species that do migrate, the distance may be quite long. Through tagging studies, a blue shark (Prionace glauca) was found to have swum 4,344 km (2,700 miles) in four months. Food availability, environmental cycles, or reproductive cycles probably determine most migrations. Females of many species migrate to specific locations to lay eggs or have pups.",
        size: "Size:-",
        Size:"The largest of the sharks is the whale shark (Rhiniodon typus). Although the whale shark averages 4 to 12 m (13-39 ft.) in length, one specimen was found to be 18 m (59 ft.) long. The smallest free-swimming whale shark observed was 56 cm (22 in.) which may be close to its birth size. Only 39 shark species are known to grow more than 3 m (10 ft.) while 176 species stay under 1 m (39 in.) in length. The spined pygmy shark (Squaliolus laticaudus) is probably the smallest of all sharks. Females reach about 18 cm (7.1 in.) in length while mature males may only be 15 cm (5.9 in.) long. For most shark species, females grow around 25% larger than males.",
        body:"Body Shape:",
        Shape:"Sharks typically have a fusiform body (rounded and tapered at both ends). This shape reduces drag and requires a minimum amount of energy to swim. Wobbegong sharks (Family Orectolobidae) and angelsharks (Family Squatinidae) have a flatter appearance than most sharks. Batoids are flattened, with a ventral mouth and gill openings.",
        Coloration: "Coloration:",
        Color :"Sharks and batoids are generally drably countershaded. Countershading is a type of camouflage in which the dorsal side is darker than the ventral side. The dark top of a countershaded animal blends in with the dark ocean depths when viewed from above. The light ventral side blends in with the lighter surface of the sea when viewed from below. The result is that predators or prey do not see a contrast between the countershaded animal and the environment. The spined pygmy shark has dense photophores covering its ventral surface but little or none on its sides or top of the body. This bioluminescent pattern has been described as 'photophore countershading'. On a moonlit night, fish swimming through the water would normally produce a shadow that predators would see. The glowing underside of the spined pygmy shark reduces or eliminates this shadow, making it less conspicuous to predators. Some sharks and batoids are camouflaged to blend in with the ocean bottom. Most stripes and other markings are juvenile colors that fade or disappear with age, as in the case of the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Some sharks, such as wobbegongs and the whale sharks, keep their markings throughout their life. ",
        Head:"Head:",
        head:"Eyes are lateral on sharks, dorsal on batoids. Some species have an eyelid-like structure called a nictitating membrane. The nictitating membrane protects the eye from being injured by thrashing prey while the shark is feeding. Sharks and batoids have ventral external nostrils. Some species have barbels near the nostrils. On both sharks and batoids, the mouth is usually ventral. It is located at the tip of the snout in the whale shark, megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios), frilled sharks (Chlamydoselachus spp.), and in the carpet sharks (Family Parascylliidae). ",
        Skin: "Scales:",
        skin : "Sharks and batoids have placoid scales, also called dermal denticles (dermal=skin, denticles=teeth). Placoid scales have the same structure as a tooth, consisting of three layers: an outer layer of vitro-dentine (an enamel), dentine, and a pulp cavity. Placoid scales are arranged in a regular pattern in sharks and an irregular pattern in batoids. Unlike other types of scales, placoid scales do not get larger as the fish grows. Instead, the fish grows more scales. Like teeth, the shape of the scales is variable among species and can be used to identify the species. Placoid scales gave rise to teeth, stingrays' spines, and the dorsal spines on horn sharks (Family Heterodontidae) and dogfishes (Family Squalidae). As a shark or batoid swims, placoid scales may create a series of vortices or whirlpools behind each scale. This enables a shark to swim efficiently. Placoid scales may also create drag when compared to other animals. The drag on a brown shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) is up to ten times greater than the smooth and sleek skin of a dolphin. Shark skin is still used as sandpaper (called shagreen). If the denticles are removed, shark skin is used to make leather products.",
        Dentition:"Teeth:",
        dentition:"Teeth are modified, enlarged placoid scales. Sharks have numerous rows of teeth attached at their bases by connective tissue. Several rows of replacement teeth continually develop behind the outer row(s) of functional teeth. As the functional teeth fall out, replacement teeth take their place. Some species of sharks may shed as many as 30,000 teeth in a lifetime.",
        Nose: "Fins:",
        nose:"Fins are rigid, supported by cartilaginous rods. Most sharks have five different types of fins. Unlike most bony fishes, the upper lobe of a shark's caudal fin is larger than the lower lobe. As the caudal fin moves back and forth to propel the shark forward, it also moves upward. As the caudal fin continues to lift, the shark's head points down. The overall effect of the motion of the caudal fin results in a forward and downward motion. The paired pectoral fins compensate for this downward motion. One function of the rigid pectoral fins is to provide lift in the forward region of the shark's body. This counteracts the downward force caused by the caudal fin. Paired pelvic fins stabilize the shark. One or two dorsal fins stabilize the shark. Some species have dorsal fin spines. A single anal fin provides stability in species where it is present; not all sharks have an anal fin.",
        Senses:"Senses:-",
        hear:"Hearing:",
        hearing:"Sharks have only an inner ear, which consists of three chambers and an ear stone called an otolith. A shark's inner ear detects sound, acceleration, and gravity. Sharks use sound to locate food. Sound is often the first sense a shark relies on to detect prey. Under water, sound travels farther and approximately 4.5 times faster than on land. Sharks are attracted to low-frequency pulsed sounds, similar to those wounded or ill prey would emit. Most attractive sounds are in the frequency range of 25 to 100 Hz. Some sharks are attracted to sound sources from distances as great as 250 m (820 ft.). The lateral line canals contain a number of sensory cells called neuromasts. Tiny hair-like structures on the neuromasts project out into the canal. Water movement created by turbulence, currents, or vibrations displaces these hair-like projections and stimulates the neuromasts. This stimulation triggers a nerve impulse to the brain. Like the ear, the lateral line senses low-frequency vibrations. It functions mainly in distance perception and detecting low-frequency vibrations and directional water flow.",
        eye:"Eyesight:",
        Eyesight:"Sharks have a basic vertebrate eye, but it is laterally compressed. The lens is large and spherical. Although the threshold of a shark's visual acuity has not been demonstrated, it is apparent that they are well-suited for seeing in dim light. Their eyes are particularly sensitive to moving objects. Sharks have a large proportion of rods, which are highly sensitive to changes in light intensity, making sharks sensitive to contrasts of light and shadow. The eye has a layer of reflecting plates called tapetum lucidum behind the retina. These plates act as mirrors to reflect light back through the retina a second time. The tapetum lucidum of a shark is twice as effective as that of a cat. In bright light, pigments temporarily cover and block the tapetum to prevent eye damage from intense light. Unlike those of other fishes, a shark's pupil can dilate and contract. Cone cells are present, indicating that sharks may have some sort of color vision. In clear water, a shark's vision is effective at a distance up to about 15 m (50 ft.). Some sharks are extremely sensitive to direct sunlight. Puffadder shysharks (Haploblepharus edwardsii) curl their tails back to cover their eyes if they are pulled out of the water. ",
        Taste:"Taste:",
        taste:"Sharks and batoids have taste buds inside their mouths. These taste buds have not been studied extensively. Taste may be responsible for a shark's final acceptance or rejection of prey items. Some sharks seem to prefer certain foods over others and have been known to spit out things that may have had an unpleasant taste.",
        Smell:"Smell:",
        smell:"Paired external nostrils with an incurrent and an excurrent opening lead to ventral olfactory organs (organs which function in smelling). Olfactory organs are blind sacs which are not connected with the mouth. Sharks have an acute sense of smell. They are well-known for their ability to detect minute quantities of substances such as blood in the water. Sharks can detect a concentration as low as one part per billion of some chemicals, such as certain amino acids. A shark's sense of smell functions up to hundreds of meters away from a source. Some sharks have 'whiskers' or barbels near the nostril area. The mandarin dogfish (Cirrhigaleus barbifer) trails its long barbels on the ocean floor. Presumably the barbels enhance tactile or chemoreceptors. This feature can be found on other species such as sawsharks (family Pristiophoridae) and nurse sharks (family Ginglymostomatidae).",
        Communication:"Longevity & Causes of Death:-",
        Sound:"Longevity:",
        Production:"Little is known about the growth and age of elasmobranchs. Many of the conventional methods for aging animals, such as examining teeth, will not work with elasmobranchs. Sharks grow slowly compared to bony fishes, possibly due to sharks' slow digestive time and feeding rates. There is considerable variation in age and growth rates between species and even between populations of the same species. ",
        Language:"Human Interaction:",
        language:"Sharks are vulnerable to overfishing. Because sharks are slow-growing and a single female produces only a few hundred pups or less in a lifetime, depleted populations may take years or decades to recover. Recreational and commercial shark harvesting has increased in the past several years due to an increased demand for sharks and shark products. Shark skin can be abrasive, so it is used as a sandpaper (called shagreen) in some countries. If the denticles are removed, leather products of the finest quality can be manufactured. Teeth of the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) are used by natives to cut hair and the skin is placed on the outside of their boats for added strength. Tiger shark vertebrae are crushed into the powder used by geisha girls. Tiger shark teeth are used for jewelry, with a complete jaw worth approximately $200 in places like Tahiti.Medicinally, parts of sharks are used for a variety of reasons including hemorrhoid treatments, vitamin supplements, artificial skin to treat burn patients, acne medication, anti-clotting blood compounds, and human cornea transplants. A substance called squalamine, found in the liver, stomach, and gall bladder of some dogfish, is believed to slow the growth of human brain tumors. Shark cartilage is also being tested for treatments against the growth of tumor cells. No part of the shark, however, is as economically valuable as their fins. Particularly wasteful, shark finning is the practice where the fins are removed from the shark and the rest of the shark is simply discarded. Shark fins can be worth up to $25 per pound, compared to shark meat which is valued at only $0.50 to $7 per pound. The fins are used primarily to make shark fin soup, a delicacy in Asia. A bowl of shark fin soup can cost as much as $150 a bowl. Each year, thousands of sharks are taken unintentionally in nets set out to catch other types of fishes. It's estimated that at least 100 million sharks are killed by humans every year.",

        Individual:"Shark Attacks:",
        individual:"Only 32 species of sharks have been identified with attacks on humans or boats. These species have three features in common: they prey on fish or marine mammals, grow to a large size, and frequent warmer coastal waters where swimmers are apt to be. In 1958, the U. S. Office of Naval Research and the American Institute of Biological Sciences set up the Shark Research Panel - a union of scientists that gathered documentation on shark attacks and compiled the information into the Shark Attack File. The Shark Research Panel documented the following:  Humans become prey by accident. Most shark attacks involved people handling hooked or snared sharks or spearfishermen handling wounded fish. Through sight or sound, a shark may confuse swimmers or divers for prey. Sharks may also attack from a territorial drive, with no intention to feed. A characteristic swimming pattern called agonistic display usually precedes attacks out of territoriality. The shark shakes its head and swims erratically with a hunched back, pectoral fins pointing down, and snout pointing up. An analysis of 1,000 recent shark attacks world-wide showed that well over 50% of the attacks were not feeding-related. Up to 60% of shark attack injuries are slashes of the upper jaw teeth. This behavior is typical of courtship advances by some male sharks.  Sharks may also injure victims by bumping them vigorously, but mostly sharks move in cautiously when attacking. A great white shark rushes towards its prey, attacking from beneath and behind. These sharks rely on stealth and surprise to prey on seals, sea lions, and other marine mammals. The Shark Screen is like a plastic sleeping bag that floats in the water. Most shark attacks occur on easier to bite targets like arms and legs. A person inside the Shark Screen appears as one mass and offers no easy target for a shark to bite. Body chemicals and blood cannot escape into the water as well.",
        Eating:"Eating Habits:-",
        Food:"Food Intake:",
        Intake:"In a zoological environment, a shark eats about 1% to 10% of its total body weight per week. Studies on sharks in the wild show similar food intake. In other words, a 2.75 m (9 ft.) sand tiger shark weighing 131kg (289 lb.) may eat just 2 to 6 kg (4-13 lb.) a week."

        detail: "Orangutans inhabit tropical forests. Tropical forests have little variance in temperature (around 23 degrees Celsius) and length of daylight (around 12 hours). However, rainfall varies considerably and is a primary factor as to the type of vegetation that grows in an area. Borneo and Sumatra represent only 1.3% of Indonesia's land mass but support 10% of its known plant species, 12.5% of its mammals, and 17% of its other vertebrates (animals with backbones). Borneo alone has around 15,000 species of flowering plants, which is equivalent to the flowering plant diversity of the entire African continent.",
        distribution: "Distribution:",
        details: "Central Bornean orangutans (P.p.wurmbii) inhabit the following Borneo habitat units: Sebangau, Tanjung Puting, Belantikan, Mawas, and Gunung Palung. Refer to Taxonomy—Subspecies for general distribution. Northeast Bornean orangutans (P.p.morio) inhabit the following Borneo habitat units: Sabah Foundation Forestry Concession (east), Kinabatangan and Gunung Gajah/Berau/Kutai. Refer to Taxonomy—Subspecies for general distribution. Northwest Bornean orangutans (P.p.pygmaeus) inhabit the following Borneo habitat units: Batang Ai/Lanjak-Entimau/Betung—Kerihun and Danau—Sentarum. Refer to Taxonomy-Subspecies for general distribution. Sumatran orangutans inhabit northern Sumatra in isolated forest areas north of Lake Toba.",
        population:"Population:",
        Details: "Orangutans are classified as endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Orangutans are listed in Appendix I of CITES. A 2004 population estimate of Bornean orangutans was about 57,000. A 2004 population estimate of Sumatran orangutans was about 7,300. This subspecies is listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN.",
        size: "Size:-",
        Size:"Orangutans are the world's largest arboreal (tree-dwelling) mammals. Adult males weigh between 50 to 90 kg (110 to 198 lb.) and can stand between 1.25 to 1.5 m (4.1-5 ft.) in height. Adult females weigh between 30 to 50 kg (66 to 110 lb.) and stand about one m (3.3 ft.) in height.",
        body:"Shoulders & Arms:",
        Shape:"Orangutan arms are one and a half times longer than their legs. When stretched out to the sides, an adult male orangutan’s arms may measure 213 cm (7 ft.) in length. Their strong arm muscles enable them to swing from tree to tree and, along with its shoulders, support the weight of their body. Although not as strong as a gorilla, an orangutan is about seven times stronger than a human. Since orangutans primarily move through the forest using their arms and shoulders as opposed to their legs and hips, their arms are longer than their legs and their shoulders are wider than their hips.", 
        Coloration: "Hair & Coloration:",
        Color :"Orangutan coloration can vary greatly between dark-brown and pale reddish-orange but is most often reddish-orange in color. Refer to Taxonomy—Species for species specific coloration. Orangutan hair is thin and shaggy",
        Head:"Brain:",
        head:"The cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls posture and movement. Apes have larger cerebellums than humans, a trait that probably reflects the demands of an arboreal, tree-dwelling lifestyle.",

        skin : "Orangutans, like other apes, do not have tails.",
        Dentition:"Dentition:",
        dentition:"Orangutans have 32 teeth, the same number as humans.",
        Nose: "Mouth:",
        nose:"In addition to eating, orangutans will carry large objects in their mouths while keeping their hands and feet free for traveling. Orangutans have powerful jaws capable of cracking, crushing, and chewing fibrous foods such as fruit with spiny coverings, nuts, and tree bark. Orangutans use their lips to detect food textures before biting into them and to exaggerate facial expressions used in communication.",
         hand:"Hands & Feet:",
        feet:"Orangutan fingers and toes are long and curved to help hold and quickly release branches as they traverse the treetops. The thumb and big toe of orangutans oppose the other digits (fingers/ toes), enabling them to grasp and manipulate objects. The opposable thumbs and big toes are small in size so they do not hinder swinging through the forest. Orangutan feet are adapted for climbing trees. Their feet grasp branches and serve as an extra support, in addition to their hands, when hanging upside-down. Orangutans can hold, eat, and manipulate food using their hands or just their feet. This agility allows them to even place a foot in their mouth while hanging from a branch. All primates have individualized fingerprints and toeprints, which may be used for identification purposes in the field. Primates have fingernails and toenails rather than claws. They are used for opening, scraping, cleaning, and scratching.",
        Senses:"Senses:-",
        hear:"Hearing:",
        hearing:"In general, smaller primate species hear higher frequencies than larger species. Great apes and humans have reduced high-pitch detection, but better discrimination of sounds in the middle of the hearing range. It was once thought reduced high-pitch detection of primates was an adaptation for speech. It is now thought to have diminished due to the absence of selective pressure to hear high frequencies.",
        eye:"Vision:",
        Eyesight:"Primates have forward facing eyes rather than one on each side of their head. This provides binocular vision because each eye's field of vision overlaps creating a three dimensional image. Binocular vision enables primates to accurately assess distances and depth which is extremely useful for maneuvering within their complex environment. Primates extensively rely on their keen eyesight and color vision. Color vision helps primates detect ripe fruits and vegetation. Primates have a skeletal structure, called a postorbital closure, which forms a bony cup around each eye. The closure helps protect primates' foremost sense—vision.",
        Taste:"Touch:",
        taste:"Touching is most often seen between mothers and infants. Infant orangutans are in constant physical contact with their mothers for the first two years of their lives. Orangutans will use their lips, tongues, hands, and feet to assist with self-grooming. Because they are highly flexible, orangutans can groom almost any part of their bodies. Female orangutans engage in social grooming more often than males.",
        Smell:"Smell:",
        smell:"The sense of smell is not as keen as other senses, such as vision, for diurnal (active during the day) primates. However, it still plays a role in reproduction, communication, and food evaluation in most primate species.",
        Communication:"Longevity & Causes of Death:-",
        Sound:"Longevity:",
        Production:"Orangutans may live more than 40 years.",
        Language:"Diseases & Predators:",
        language:"Like most great apes, orangutans are susceptible to many human diseases and ailments. Aside from human activity, young orangutans are preyed on by clouded leopards, bearded pigs, crocodiles, pythons, and black eagles.",
        Behavior:"Behavior:-",
        Observation:"Social Structure:",
        observation:"Unusual in primates, orangutans are primarily solitary (live alone). Social behavior varies between Bornean and Sumatran orangutans in that Sumatran orangutans have access to more fruit and sharing opportunities, leading to greater sociability. Although primarily solitary in nature, there is growing support that orangutans live in loose (widely-spaced) communities. Because female offspring generally establish home ranges near their mothers, these loose communities consist of clusters of related females and an adult male with whom they all prefer to mate. Young orangutans are highly social, establishing bonds with same gender and age mates. As they approach adolescence (seven to ten years of age), males move off on their own and females will often establish home ranges near their mothers. Adult males are the most solitary, engaging in threatening displays upon meeting other males. They share company with females only for reproductive purposes.",
        Social:"Social Behavior:",
        social:"Males are generally intolerant of each other and will avoid each other in overlapping home ranges. If two males meet, a confrontation is likely to occur. Threatening displays often include staring, inflating their throat pouches, producing long call vocalizations, and shaking branches. Females are more tolerant of each other than males and will occasionally spend time together feeding. If both females have young, the offspring will play together during their mothers' feeding time.",
        Individual:"Individual Behavior:",
        individual:"Orangutans use sticks to help knock fruit down from trees and as visual deterrents when threatened (shaking and/or throwing them). Leaves have been used as a sponge to obtain water from streams and to wipe unwanted substances from their hair. Bornean orangutans have been observed taking shelter from the sun or rain by holding twigs or leaves over their heads. Sumatran orangutans have been observed making leaf gloves or cushions to protect themselves when consuming thorny foods. Orangutans construct nests in trees just before sunset each night. Most often located near the last food source visited for the day, the nests are formed by bending and weaving small branches. Nests are built 18 to 28 m (60-90 ft.) up in the trees. Branches used in nest construction are usually tested by swinging on them to ensure its strength can withstand their weight for up to 14 hours of sleep. Nests can take up to 30 minutes to build. Brachiation refers to the manner in which orangutans move through trees. Using their long fingers to hook over a branch, they swing forward grasping the next branch with the other hand. In this manner, orangutans traverse the treetops hand over hand. Orangutans climb trees as high as 45 m (150 ft.) and often do not touch the ground for three weeks at a time. Orangutans do not readily go into open water but have been documented wading in waist-deep water to attain food sources.",
        Eating:"Eating Habits:-",
        Food:"Water Intake & Diet:",
        Intake:"Orangutans get most of their water from the succulent fruits they eat, but will also drink from rivers and streams. Mother orangutans sometimes let their young drink from their mouths. Nearly 90% of orangutans' diet is composed of fruit. They eat more than 400 different plant varieties. Orangutans favor a fruit called durians. Durians are covered in sharp spines and have a pungent smell. Orangutans use a variety of tools and their powerful jaws to break into such fruits. Refer to Tool Use section. Although fruit comprises most of the orangutan's diet, they still require other nutrients as part of their daily intake. They receive a mixture of sugars and fats from fruit, carbohydrates from leaves, and protein from nuts. Orangutans spend up to six hours a day eating or foraging for food. As fruit-eating animals, orangutans are important propagators of tropical plants. Many fruit seedlings sprout only after having passed through an animal's digestive system. Therefore, orangutans have a vital ecological role as seed dispersers in their rainforest environment and affect forest regeneration and plant-species diversity."

        detail: "A diurnal bird of prey species can be found in almost every type of habitat, from the Arctic tundra to the desert. Populations of peregrine falcons and gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) breed in the Arctic. Peregrines prefer tundra, while gyrfalcons prefer the northern edges of boreal forests. Species found in desert habitats include prairie falcons (Falco mexicanus) in the U.S. and Mexico, and lappetfaced vultures (Torgos tracheliotus) in Africa. Ospreys and bald eagles occupy areas near lakes, rivers, and coasts. Sharp-shinned hawks (Accipiter striatus) and northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) are generally found in or around coniferous forests. A number of species can be found in grassland habitats, including the Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsoni). Savannas, which are tropical and subtropical grasslands with scattered trees, support a variety of species including whiteheaded vultures (Trigonoceps occipitalis) and bateleur eagles (Terathopius ecaudatus). American kestrels (Falco sparverius) are widely distributed and ecologically versatile. They can be found in alpine areas down to deserts, grasslands, forests, and human suburbs. Habitat specialists include the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), which is restricted to freshwater marshes by its diet of apple snails. Migratory species occupy both breeding and nonbreeding habitats.",
        distribution: "Distribution:",
        details: "Representatives of Falconidae, Accipitridae, and Pandionidae can be found on every continent worldwide, except Antarctica. Some species, like the osprey and peregrine falcon, are global. Others, like the Seychelles kestrel (Falco araea) of the Seychelles islands, are restricted to certain regions. The secretary bird is endemic (restricted) to sub-Saharan Africa. New World vultures are found in the Western Hemisphere, specifically North and South America. Old World vultures are found in the Eastern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and Africa.",
        migration:"Migration:",
        Detail: "True migration in birds involves a seasonal movement (usually fall and spring) between a breeding region and a nonbreeding or 'wintering' region. Migration enhances survival for birds whose breeding grounds have harsh winters. Conversely, migration allows birds to return to breeding areas that have abundant food supplies for raising young. The majority of migration routes have a north and south direction. About 95% of all land birds breeding between 40° and 50° North latitude fly south for the winter (Welty, 1982). Birds are believed to navigate by using an inherited internal map as well as the position of the moon, stars, and sun; the earth's magnetism; landscape features; and/or past experience. To supply the considerable energy needed for migration, birds accumulate extra body fat two to three weeks before departure. Long-distance migrants include the Swainson's hawk and the tundra-breeding peregrine falcon (Falco p. tundrius). A banded Swainson's hawk traveled 11,500 km (7,146 mi.) from Saskatchewan to Argentina in 126 days. A peregrine falcon flew from Canada's Northwest Territories to Argentina in 174 days, covering 15,000 km (9,321 mi.) (Johnsgard, 1990). Eastern red-footed falcons (Falco amurensis) migrate between eastern Siberia and southern Africa (Pickford and Tarboton, 1989). A relatively short-distance migrator is the resident black kite (Milvus migrans) of Africa, which migrates from the southern Sahara Desert to the Cape of Africa (Pickford and Tarboton, 1989). In partial migrant species, some individuals of a population are residents year-round, while others are migratory. Bald eagles are considered to be partial migrants (Kerlinger, 1989). A few species are nomadic. Brown snake eagles (Circaetus cinereus) move about the African savanna stopping where food is plentiful and moving on when conditions decline.",
        size: "Size:-",
        Size:"One of the smallest diurnal birds of prey is the pygmy falcon (Polihierax semitorquatus) of Africa, which reaches a weight of about 60 g (2.1 oz.) and has a wingspan of about 0.3 m (1 ft.) (Pickford and Tarboton, 1989). The smallest North American diurnal bird of prey is the American kestrel. American kestrels weigh about 120 g (4.2 oz.) and have a wingspan of about 0.2 m (0.7 ft.) (Johnsgard, 1990). The largest diurnal bird of prey is the Andean condor, which weighs up to 14 kg (31 lbs.) and has a wing span of up to 3.2 m (10.5 ft.). The largest North American bird of prey is the California condor with a wingspan of up to 2.9 m (9.5 ft.) (Martin, 1987). The tallest diurnal bird of prey is the secretary bird with a height of up to 1.3 m (4.3 ft.) (Pickford and Tarboton, 1989). ",
        body:"Body Shape:",
        Shape:"In general, the bodies of diurnal birds of prey are fusiform in shape (rounded and tapering at both ends). This body shape reduces drag while flying.", 
        Coloration: "Coloration:",
        Color :"Most diurnal birds of prey have subdued feather colors, mainly browns, rust, black, white, and some blues and grays. Old and New World vultures may have subdued feather colors, but the skin color of their heads and/or necks can be quite vivid. The king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa) is a striking example, with a head and neck boldly patterned in yellow, orange, and black. Males and females are usually identical in color except in some harriers and falcons. In merlins (Falco columbarius) and American kestrels, the males' wings are gray-blue from above while the females' are brown. Many species have an immature plumage and an adult plumage. Immature bald eagles are completely brown in coloration, while adults have a distinctive white head and tail. Some species, especially hawks in the genus Buteo, have light and dark color morphs (variations). This polymorphism seems to be related to habitat. In red-tailed hawks, dark colored birds are more common in the open country of the western U.S., while light colored birds are more prevalent in the forested areas of the eastern U.S.",
        Head:"Head:",
        head:"The eyes of diurnal birds of prey are set on either side of the head, facing forward. Most hawks, eagles, and falcons have a distinctive shelf or 'eyebrow' above and in front of the eye. The eyebrow is thought to shade the eye from the sun and provide some physical protection. The membrane spreads fluid across the eye, keeping the eye moist. Birds most likely use the membrane when flying on windy days or when dust and debris are in the air. Two nasal openings lie at the base of the upper bill, in the cere. Falcons have bony tubercles in their nostrils that may act like air baffles, slowing airflow through the nasal passages during high speed stoops.",
        Skin: "Tails:",
        skin : "Tail feathers attach to the pygostyle or tail bone. Like wings, tails create lift and balance in flight. Tails are also used as a rudder for turning, and a brake for landing. Tail shape and length corresponds to a bird's hunting technique. Birds dependent on fast, open flight to catch prey tend to have short tails (falcons). Birds that need quick maneuverability pursuing prey through brush have long tails (Accipiter hawks). The distinctive forked tail of the American swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus) provides extra lift as the bird flies at slow speeds capturing insects.",
        Dentition:"Skin:",
        dentition:"Compared with other vertebrates, birds have thin skin. Specialized cells in the skin produce feathers, scales, claws, and the outer layer of beaks. Like human fingernails and hair, these external structures are made of keratin. Stored fat attached to the innermost layer of skin helps prevent heat loss as well as provide energy during migration. Smooth muscles in the skin permit birds to fluff feathers (forming an insulating layer of trapped air) when the weather is cold, spread feathers when flying, or press feathers against the body (to lose heat) when the weather is warm. Most birds have a uropygial, or preen gland, located on the upper surface of the rump and covered by feathers. The gland secretes oils used by the bird when preening. These oils are believed to help waterproof feathers and condition exposed skin. The oils may also have substances which control bacterial and fungal infections, as well as contain vitamin D. Birds don't have sweat glands.",
        Nose: "Feathers:",
        nose:"Feathers provide birds with insulation, skin protection, a streamlined surface for flight, and coloration. There are six types of feathers: vaned, down, semiplume, filoplume, bristle, and powder down. Vaned feathers are divided into contour feathers (on the body for streamlining and protection) and flight feathers (extending beyond the body for flight). Vaned feathers have a central shaft, creating two vane webs on either side. The webs are held together and flat by hundreds of barbs, barbules, and hooklets. Down feathers are short, fluffy, insulating feathers, usually hidden under contour feathers. Semiplume feathers are intermediate in structure between contour and down feathers. They're also found under contour feathers and are mainly for insulation. Powder down feathers are the only feathers that grow continuously. They are scattered throughout the plumage and their tips crumble into a talclike powder. The powder, which is spread by the bird during preening, helps to waterproof and preserve the feathers. Feathers aren't evenly distributed over the body, but grow along specific feather tracts. Adult birds are completely covered with feathers expect for the legs, feet, beak, and sometimes head. Most vultures have featherless or sparsely feathered heads, which can be easily cleaned after feeding on carcasses. Most adult birds molt (shed) and renew their feathers once a year after the breeding season. The old and worn feathers are actually pushed out of their follicles by the new feathers growing underneath. The speed of the molt depends on the species and location. In most species, the molt lasts four to eight weeks. Peregrine falcons in southern Europe molt in five to six weeks. Arctic peregrine populations molt for about two months in summer, stop the molt while migrating, then resume molting in their winter quarters. Large eagles may require two years for a complete molt (Welty, 1982). Chicks are hatched with a natal down, which is replaced by a juvenile plumage before they leave the nest. The juvenile plumage may then be replaced by adult plumage or a number of immature plumages, depending upon the species. Bald eagles take four or five years to reach adult plumage (Scott, 1987).",
         hand:"Beak:",
        feet:"The bird's beak, or bill, is made of bone and covered by horny plates made of keratin. The beak is strongly hooked at the tip and sharp on the edges. Modern birds don't have teeth. The beaks of some species are modified according to feeding habits. The upper mandible of the snail kite is elongated for extracting snails from shells. The base of the upper bill is soft and fleshy, forming the cere. Ceres are an adaptation to a meat-eating diet. A lack of feathers around the beak makes for easy cleaning after feeding. In falcons, the upper mandible of the beak is notched, forming a 'tooth'. This tooth is used to break the cervical vertebrae of captured prey.",
        Senses:"Senses:-",
        hear:"Hearing:",
        hearing:"Birds are most sensitive to sounds with frequencies between 1 and 5 kHz. The upper limit of hearing is about 10 kHz (Brooke and Birkhead, 1991). Humans can hear sounds with frequencies as low as 0.02 kHz and as high as 17 kHz.",
        eye:"Eyesight:",
        Eyesight:"Vision is a diurnal bird of prey's most important sense for hunting and reacting to danger. Diurnal birds of prey have excellent vision. The eyes are proportionally larger than the eyes of other vertebrates, providing larger and sharper visual images. The retina has more rods and cones (the eye's sensory cells) and is one-half to two times as thick as the retina of other vertebrates. More sensory cells mean better visual acuity. As in humans, the point of sharpest vision is the fovea. Foveae are funnel-like areas of the retina packed with color-perceiving cone cells. Humans have one fovea per eye, while diurnal birds of prey have two. In addition, many diurnal birds of prey have proportionately more sensory cells in the upper half of the retina. This helps a bird perceive images when looking toward the ground from a perch or when flying. As a consequence, to scan the sky, they must turn their heads upside down. Like humans, diurnal birds of prey focus on objects through binocular vision (using two eyes to see); but, can easily detect movement at the edges of their viewing range using just one eye. Diurnal birds of prey are thought to see objects at a distance about the same as or up to three times better than humans. The wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax) can discern objects at a distance twice as far as humans. On the other hand, an American kestrel has visual acuity equal to a human's (Martin, 1987). Diurnal birds of prey see color, which may play an important role in food identification and reproductive behavior.",
        Taste:"Taste:",
        taste:"Birds have an acute sense of taste. Taste is used to help avoid harmful foods. Sensory receptors inside the bird's mouth detect sweet, salt, sour (acid), and bitter tastes. Sensitivity to each of these tastes differs from species to species",
        Smell:"Smell:",
        smell:"The importance of smell differs from species to species. Most diurnal birds of prey aren't sensitive to smell. An exception is the turkey vulture, which is able to locate carrion from the air by smell alone (Brooke and Birkhead, 1991).",
        Communication:"Longevity & Causes of Death:-",
        Sound:"Longevity:",
        Production:"Little is known about the longevity of diurnal birds of prey in the wild. One banded osprey lived 32 years, a golden eagle lived 25 years, and a honey buzzard lived 29 years (Welty, 1982). More complete records exist for birds in zoological parks. In general, small falcons and Accipiter hawks live about 15 years. Medium-sized buzzards and kites live 20 to 40 years, and large vultures and eagles have occasionally lived 40 to 55 years (Newton, 1979).",
        Language:"Disease & Parasitism:",
        language:"Diurnal birds of prey are exposed to a variety of bacterial, viral, and fungal diseases, as well as internal and external parasites from the prey they eat. Though not usually fatal, infections may make a bird weak and vulnerable to other environmental factors.",
        Behavior:"Behavior:-",
        Observation:"Daily Activity:",
        observation:"Daily activity changes from season to season. During the winter months, diurnal birds of prey spend most of their time hunting, sitting (perching when not hunting), and roosting (sleeping or perching at a sleeping location). When sitting and roosting, birds typically spend time preening (maintaining their feathers). During the spring and summer, time is spent hunting, sitting, roosting, defending territory, pair-bonding, nest building, incubating eggs, and brooding young. Daily activity varies between males and females during different seasons. In one study for example, male and female kestrels in winter spent approximately the same amount of time per 24-hour day hunting, sitting, and roosting (Brooke and Birkhead, 1991). However, during spring incubation, female kestrels spent 65% of the day incubating, 2% hunting, 4% sitting, and 29% roosting. Males spent 8% of the time incubating, 46% hunting, 17% sitting, and 29% roosting (Brooke and Birkhead, 1991). In summer, when nestlings were present, female kestrels spent 13% of the day brooding, 45% hunting, 17% sitting, and 25% roosting. Males, on the other hand, spent no time brooding, 54% of the time hunting, 21% of the time sitting, and 25% of the time roosting (Brooke and Birkhead, 1991).",
        Social:"Social Behavior:",
        social:"As a group, diurnal birds of prey are not particularly social birds. The main social unit is the breeding pair. Some species, such as broad-winged hawks (Buteo platypterus), defend territories in the breeding season, but migrate as a flock. Other species, such as the cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres), nest in colonies, and hunt alone or in groups. Colonies are an adaptation to limited nesting and feeding areas. Most pairs defend their own nest area, but may join other colony members to help drive away potential predators. Carrion-eating birds of the same and different species are often seen feeding on the same carcass.",
        Individual:"Vocalizations:",
        individual:"Both male and female diurnal birds of prey typically vocalize in defense of territory and when courting mates. Except for a few species, like the chanting goshawks (genus Melierax), the vocals are not melodic, but a series of short, loud calls or whistles. New World vultures vocalize through wheezes, snorts, and hisses, due to their lack of a syrinx.",
        Eating:"Eating Habits:-",
        Food:"Food Intake:",
        Intake:"Smaller birds have a larger surface area to body volume ratio than larger birds, causing them to lose body heat more rapidly. To compensate, smaller birds usually eat proportionately more food than larger birds to maintain their metabolism and body temperature. A nonbreeding black-shouldered kite (Elanus caeruleus) weighing on average 0.25 kg (.55 lb.) eats about 20% of its body weight per day (Pickford and Tarboton, 1989). On the other hand, a cape vulture weighing on average 9 kg (20 lb.) eats about 6% of its body weight per day (Pickford and Tarboton, 1989). In many species the female is larger than the male and therefore captures and consumes larger prey. For instance, the average female sharp-shinned hawk captures prey weighing up to 300 g (0.7 lb.), while the average male captures prey weighing up to 100 g (0.2 lb.). Scientists believe the size difference between mated pairs reduces competition for food during the breeding season (Johnsgard, 1990). Food consumption is also influenced by season. Food intake increases in cold weather, before migration, and before egg laying (in females)."
